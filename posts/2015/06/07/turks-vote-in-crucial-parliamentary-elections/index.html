                <p>The outcome of the polls could also determine whether ruling party politicians can rewrite the constitution to bolster the powers of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</p>
<p>The ballot boxes opened at 8am local time (0500GMT) and will close at 5pm (1400GMT), with non-official results expected by the end of the day.</p>
<p>Public surveys prior to the election indicated the conservative Justice and Development Party (AK party) was in the lead.</p>
<p>The AK party, the ruling party for the past 13 years, is seeking to secure two-thirds of the 550 seats in the parliament in order to change the constitution to replace Turkey's 92-year-old parliamentary system for a presidential system.</p>
<p>However, the majority of surveys suggest that a victory with such a large margin is unlikely for the party.</p>
<p>All the other three main parties likely to pass Turkey's 10 percent threshold for entry to the parliament - the centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP), the Nationalist Action Party (MHP) and the left-wing pro-Kurdish People's Democracy Party (HDP) - are against such a change.</p>
<p>Galip Dalay, a senior fellow with the Al Jazeera Center for Studies on Turkey and Kurdish affairs, said the election has been reduced to a referendum on whether Turkey should change its political system or not.</p>
<p>However, Turkish voters acoss the nation told Al Jazeera that corruption, economic promises and the Kurdish issue were also important to their voting decisions.</p>
<p>Kurdish dispute</p>
<p>The run-up to the elections has seen discussions on the Kurdish dispute in the context of ongoing peace talks with the outlawed armed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).</p>
<p>Only the Nationalist Action Party, Turkey's third largest party, opposes the talks.</p>
<p>The election campaign has been marred by several bomb attacks on HDP offices.</p>
<p>Salih Sonmez, 42, a Kurdish cook from Mersin, said his entire family had voted for the AK party in the last few elections but was not getting his vote this time.</p>
<p>"The AK party promised us hope, but they made Turkey worse.</p>
<p>Economic issues</p>
<p>In the sphere of economy, three opposition parties have made big economic promises to the public, including substantial rises in the minimum wage.</p>
<p>These promises were dismissed as unrealistic by AK party officials and Erdogan, who criticised the opposition for starting "a tender for the minimum wage" that would "increase unemployment".</p>
<p>The AK party took over an economy reeling from high levels of inflation and unemployment, and is credited with restoring stability by pushing growth through trade and foreign investment.</p>
<p>Emel Huba, 55, a pensioner from Istanbul, said she would vote for the CHP "to get rid of this corrupt government".</p>
<p>"The president stays in his presidential palace that is worth billions of dollars, but the government does not want to spare a small raise to pensioners," Huba said.</p>
<p>"This is wasteful and unfair.</p>
<p>Gokalp Ali Baz, 28, a financial adviser in Ankara, said he would vote for the MHP "because I don't believe my vote is going to change much in Turkey or rather, the country is going to change much following the elections".</p>
<p>"The country is not going well and it is going to be even worse.</p>
<p>Mehmet Kin, 31, a shop owner in Istanbul, said he would vote for the Communist party as he feared that "a worse Turkey awaits us after the elections".</p>
<p>"In Turkey, the elections are never fair, even in cases where there is no systematic corruption in elections," Kin said.</p>
<p>"People counting the votes can act in a subjective way and call some of the votes invalid in line with their political views.</p>
<p>But others said they would vote for the AK party again as they wanted Turkey to remain stable.</p>
<p>"I do not want a coalition government," Omar Harman, 19, Ã‚ a waiter in Istanbul, said.</p>
<p>"Promises by other parties, such as large increases of the minimum wage, are not realistic."</p>
<p>Munevver Karaca, 52, a housewife from Sivas, was also going to vote with the AK party "because of its services to this nation in many ways".</p>
<p>"I think Turkey is having the best times in its history," Karaca said.</p>
