                <p>Beirut, Lebanon - A series of oil exploration deals, which may be worth billions of dollars to Lebanon's economy, are being held up amid the country's presidential vacuum and political chaos as crude prices continue to fall.</p>
<p>A total of 46 transnational energy giants - including Total, Shell, Chevron and ExxonMobil - qualified in April 2013 to enter the first round of licensing to explore Lebanon's offshore resource potential.</p>
<p>Arthur Nazarian, Lebanon's energy and water minister, was cornered by a journalist in March, asking when the cabinet would sign off on the two decrees necessary to kick-start natural gas and oil exploration.</p>
<p>VIDEO:Â What's driving oil prices down?</p>
<p>Given the country's ongoing political instability, maritime territorial disputes with Israel, and drops in global fuel prices, industry insiders warn that international investors could look elsewhere.</p>
<p>"Companies become selective in terms of allocating limited resources."</p>
<p>Civil society groups and industry watchdogs, however, are using the delays to develop a stronger understanding of the oil and gas sector and its potential benefits and costs to Lebanon.</p>
<p>"We are happy it has stopped for now," Laury Haytayan, MENA senior associate at the Natural Resource Governance Institute, told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>The vast majority of people didn't know anything about the sector, and so could not hold the government accountable; plus, we need to know how to manage people's expectations.</p>
<p>Laury Haytayan,Â MENA senior associate at the Natural Resource Governance Institute</p>
<p>More conservative estimates hypothesise the existence of 25 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves - still a substantial find.</p>
<p>In the past month, ENI, the Italian energy giant, announced that it had failed to discover any recoverable amount of natural gas following two preliminary drillings in one of the island country's 11 allocated areas.</p>
<p>Despite the political stasis, Lebanon's oil and gas sector has not come to a complete standstill.</p>
<p>The Lebanese government this year signed a three-year deal with Norway, which will see Norwegian experts provide customised technical training, joint conferences, and delegation visits to Norway for MPs, civil society organisations and the media alike, aimed at strengthening accountability and transparency within the sector.</p>
<p>The establishment of a sovereign wealth fund to utilise resources accrued from the sector for equitable social development has been identified by Nakhle and othersÂ -Â such as Jeremy Arbid, a journalist with Executive, a Lebanese business and policy magazine - as key to ensuring transparent, effective financial management.</p>
<p>Ensuring that the details of any contracts - known as Exploration and Production-sharing Agreements, or EPAs - between the Lebanese government and extraction companies are disclosed to the public has also been identified as crucial by the Natural Resource Governance Institute's Haytayan, and Reinoud Leenders, a researcher at King's College London who has written extensively about public sector corruption in Lebanon.</p>
<p>The second decree concerns the delineation of offshore allocations to be auctioned.</p>
<p>Leenders notes that the Lebanese public's confidence in the state's ability to manage the oil and gas sector in an efficient and transparent manner has been questioned, due to scandals implicating political figures in the embezzlement of state funds.</p>
<p>A 2013 survey carried out by the Lebanese Transparency Association, targeting 800 business owners, managers and managing directors working in the public sector, saw 73 percent of respondents confess to paying bribes to accelerate the issuing of formal documents, with 25 percent stating they had resorted to blackmail to obtain a required service.</p>
<p>Given the delays, a recent International Monetary Fund study estimated that drilling was unlikely to get under way in Lebanon before 2020.</p>
<p>RELATED:Â UN asks Israel to pay Lebanon $850m</p>
<p>These are not the first accusations of a lack of fiscal transparency to be faced by state officials.</p>
<p>Last year Gebran Bassil, the former energy minister, filed a lawsuit against Executive following the publication of an interview in which Bassil, now promoted to foreign minister, was questioned concerning the location of a purported $33m understood to have been raised from the sale of seismic data conducted on Lebanon's maritime territory.</p>
<p>This could provide a safeguard against corruption.</p>
<p>Despite the stalling political process, Lebanon still stands to benefit if considerable resources are found.</p>
<p>The competition, however,Â will be tougher - especially as new producers join the club," said Nakhle.</p>
<p>"Lebanon should not only focus on exporting potential production, but also develop its domestic market to reduce dependence on fuel oil imports and improve the quality of its power generation."</p>
<p>Lebanon imports more than 95 percent of its energy, importing more than 120,000 barrels of refined oil each day, at an annual cost of $5.11bn, or 11.4 percent of GDP in 2013.</p>
<p>Lebanon's central bank also offers interest-free loans for renewable energy initiatives repayable over a 14-month period to incentivise investment.</p>
<p>Last year, Arbid co-founded LOGI, an NGO that aims to spread awareness of key decisions facing the emerging sector.</p>
<p>She strikes a note of cautious optimism.</p>
<p>"But even a small portion could eliminate our electricity deficit - but only if the industry is managed efficiently."</p>
