                <p>Closing arguments are to be made in the fifth hearing of the much-delayed retrial in Egypt ofÂ two Al Jazeera journalists, Baher Mohamed and Mohamed Fahmy.</p>
<p>The previous four sessions in the Cairo court were all adjourned.Â Where do things stand now?</p>
<p>How many of your journalists are in court?</p>
<p>What is the latest status with the case?</p>
<p>Were you reckless in reporting from Cairo when you knew the risks?</p>
<p>Was it negligent that your journalists did not have accreditation from the Egyptian authorities?</p>
<p>Mohammed Fahmy says he has declared war on Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>Fahmy accuses you of âepic negligenceâ before the arrests.</p>
<p>Did Al Jazeera's head of security advise against the deployment of any further teams to Egypt?</p>
<p>Did Al Jazeera receive any diplomatic warnings regarding its operations in Egypt?</p>
<p>Why did you not pay Fahmy's bail?</p>
<p>Why did you not pay for Fahmy's lawyer?</p>
<p>How could you have put up such a catastrophic legal defence in the first trial?</p>
<p>Why did you put AJE reports on Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr, when Fahmy asked you not to?</p>
<p>Why did you choose to seek compensation from the Egyptian government last year?</p>
<p>Why didn't you act on Mohammed Fahmy's warnings and his offer to help mediate between Al Jazeera and the Egyptian authorities in late 2013?</p>
<p>Were your journalists caught up in a battle between Egypt and Qatar?</p>
<p>How many days did Al Jazeera's journalists spend in jail?</p>
<p>Did you pay $1.5m to protesters, as alleged by your former lawyer?</p>
<p>How could Al Jazeera have expected anything other than this situation with its Muslim Brotherhood bias?</p>
<p>OK, but the Arabic channels are biased.</p>
<p>How has the #FreeAJStaff campaign been going?</p>
<p>Two - Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed.</p>
<p>Al Jazeera Arabic presenter Ahmed Mansour was part of a separate case.</p>
<p>We continue to defend their innocence from truly bizarre charges.</p>
<p>Baher and Mohamed are guilty of nothing except excellent journalism.</p>
<p>Al Jazeera's mission is to accurately cover events and shed light on people and issues in some of the most difficult environments in the world.</p>
<p>All news organisations take risks when deploying to hostile environments.</p>
<p>Journalists take risks to bring you the information you need.</p>
<p>Thatâs where the blame properly lies.</p>
<p>None of this justifies criminal proceedings and jail time.</p>
<p>We are focused on getting him and his colleagues out of this predicament.</p>
<p>Fahmy accuses you of "epic negligence" before the arrests.</p>
<p>Nobody takes safety more seriously than Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>No, never.</p>
<p>However, the Egyptian authorities have banned Al Jazeera from access to banking facilities.</p>
<p>We elected to cover those legal fees, even though we believed that a united defence would be a better choice.</p>
<p>We hired leading Egyptian Bar-accredited lawyers.</p>
<p>Our current lawyers secured a retrial in January.</p>
<p>But AJMM also used footage from a variety of sources, including international news agencies Â and citizen journalists.</p>
<p>There wass unlikely to be a good time to table this.</p>
<p>He was finally released months later after strenuous campaigning led to mounting international pressure.</p>
<p>The advice of Fahmy and many others in Al Jazeera was taken into consideration.</p>
<p>We have always done everything possible to maintain good relations with the Egyptian government.</p>
<p>It's a recent attempt to distract people from the main issue of press freedom.</p>
<p>Baher and Mohamed were released 12 days later on bail pending retrial.</p>
<p>Al Jazeera covered the costs for his hospital suite and treatment throughout those seven months.</p>
<p>Did you pay $1.5m to protesters as alleged by your former lawyer?</p>
<p>This is patently false.</p>
<p>Only those who want to see one side of the story told, would consider Al Jazeera's reporting biased.</p>
<p>This includes governments, secularists, activists and Islamists including the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>
<p>Our Arabic channels are the most-watched and most credible in the Arab world, with Al Jazeera Arabic having more viewers than all of its competitors combined.</p>
<p>They want to go back to the situation that existed before Al Jazeera - official narratives peddled to the public.</p>
<p>â¢ Global opinion is loud and clear - the Egyptian authorities should drop all charges against Al Jazeera's journalists Our web campaign has been viral, making billions of social media impressions with the hashtag #FreeAJStaff.</p>
<p>â¢ Governments have responded, and the detentions have been criticised by the United States, European Union and others.</p>
<p>If this stands unchallenged, this formula will be repeated elsewhere.</p>
