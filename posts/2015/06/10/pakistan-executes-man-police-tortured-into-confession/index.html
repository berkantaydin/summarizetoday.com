                <p>Islamabad, Pakistan â Pakistan has executed a man who rights groups say was tortured into confessing to a murder when he was still a minor, prison officials and his lawyers have confirmed.</p>
<p>Aftab Bahadur, 37, was convicted for the murder of a woman and her two children in September 1992, when he was 15, and had been on death row for almost 23 years.</p>
<p>He was hanged on Wednesday morning at the Kot Lakhpat jail in the eastern city of Lahore, prison officials told the AFP news agency.</p>
<p>The Justice Project Pakistan (JPP), a legal rights organisation representing Bahadur, and UK-based rights group Reprieve say that Bahadur was tortured by police into confessing to the murder, and that key witnesses in the case had recanted their testimony.</p>
<p>Ghulam Mustafa, a co-accused who also maintains his innocence and who rights groups say recanted his testimony against Bahadur, was not hanged as scheduled on Wednesday, after reportedly reaching a settlement with the victimâs family.</p>
<p>RELATED: Confusion surrounds Pakistan's 'terrorist' executions</p>
<p>Maya Fou, director of Reprieveâs death penalty team, said it âwas a truly shameful day for Pakistanâs justice systemâ.</p>
<p>âAftab was subjected to almost every injustice conceivable.</p>
<p>âTo the last, Pakistan refused even to grant his lawyers the few days needed to present evidence which would have proved his innocence.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, jail authorities defied a Lahore High Court order that allowed JPP access to Mustafa, the co-accused, in order to obtain a signed affidavit of him declaring Bahadurâs innocence, JPP lawyers told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>Earlier, Pakistani authorities granted a fourth last-minute stay of execution to Shafqat Hussain, due to be hanged on Tuesday, who rights groups also claim was a minor who was tortured into confessing to a murder in 2004.</p>
<p>âWe die many timesâ</p>
<p>Speaking to Al Jazeera in February, Bahadur had said he felt it was âunjustâ for him to have been imprisoned for such a duration.</p>
<p>I feel this is unfair and unjust to keep us in such situation that we are forced to bear dual punishment of a single crime,â he said.</p>
<p>âDuring the last 23 years of my imprisonment, I have received death warrants so many times that I can't remember the exact number.Â</p>
<p>"Obviously, it feels horrible whenever the warrant had been issued.</p>
<p>âIn fact, we die many times before our death.</p>
<p>Bahadur, who was a Christian, said that he and fellow non-Muslim inmates at Kot Lakhpat Jail faced threats from other prisoners based on their faith.</p>
<p>Pakistan lifted a moratorium on executions in December, following an attack on a school in Peshawar that killed more than 141 people, most of them schoolchildren.</p>
<p>Since then, more than 130 people have been executed, mainly in cases related to murder.</p>
