                <p>The targets included a Sufi shrine and a bank where government employees were drawing their salaries.</p>
<p>The Taliban were quick to deny responsibility and even called the bombings an "evil act".</p>
<p>President Ashraf Ghani appeared on national TV soon after the attacks and also pointed the finger at "Daesh" (the Arabic term for ISIL), but without providing details.</p>
<p>Black flag</p>
<p>Soon, headlines in both Afghan and international media announced that ISIL had just pulled off one of their largest attacks yet outside the Middle East.</p>
<p>The claim of responsibility was traced back to a Facebook page, featuring a picture of one of the Balaclava-clad alleged attackers posing with a badly drawn ISIL flag.</p>
<p>The Daily BeastÂ even reported an official denial of any responsibility from ISIL's apparent spokesperson for Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>
<p>While officials both inside and outside of Kabul have nervously been looking for signs that ISIL would seek to turn Afghanistan into its next battlefield, there is little evidence of a substantive presence of the group in the country.</p>
<p>The confusion points to a larger problem.</p>
<p>While reports of various militant groups across Afghanistan operating under the ISIL flag have increased in recent months, nothing indicates that they have any formal connection to ISIL "headquarters" in Syria and Iraq.</p>
<p>There is little evidence of widespread funding or ISIL fighters travelling from the Middle East to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Exaggerated reports</p>
<p>In September last year, for example, the alleged killing of scores of people - including beheadings - in Ghazni province by "Daesh militants" hit international headlines.</p>
<p>In fact, villagers in the area said no beheadings had taken place and casualty figures were nowhere near what had been reported.</p>
<p>Ghani has frequently played up the potential of ISIL in Afghanistan, calling the group a "terrible threat"Â while addressing the US Congress in March.</p>
<p>But the new chapter's leader, Abdul Rauf Khadim, was killed in a US drone strike just weeks later - and more recent reports indicate that other senior leaders have met the same fate.</p>
<p>If ISIL is serious about expanding into Afghanistan, it faces huge challenges in doing so.</p>
<p>The Taliban has also always been a nationalist movement whose ambitions have never gone beyond Afghanistan's borders, unlike ISIL who aspire to create a global caliphate.</p>
<p>Too brutal</p>
<p>Since 2001, the Afghan Taliban have largely stayed away from sectarian attacks, and even condemned their Pakistani counterpart, whose indiscriminate suicide bombings have killed hundreds of civilians, as too barbaric.</p>
<p>The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan has over the past months, for example, claimed credit for kidnappings targeting the Shia Hazara minority as well as beheadings of Afghan soldiers.</p>
<p>The Afghan Taliban are fractured - frustrations are growing in the ranks over the continued absence of its elusive leader Mullah Omar, and there is much resistance to the proposed peace talks with the Afghan government.</p>
<p>Competition with al-Qaeda, who last year announced a new South Asia chapter, could also lead ISIL to intensify its efforts to expand beyond the Middle East, with Afghanistan and Pakistan as prime targets.</p>
<p>The UN has represented a voice of reason, calling for a thorough investigation into the Jalalabad bombings before jumping to conclusions.</p>
<p>With civilian casualties mounting, serious questions about the effectiveness of both the new government and security forces, and a mounting economic crisis, Afghanistan is facing some very real and daunting challenges.</p>
<p>He spent 2012 in Afghanistan working in the communications and humanitarian aid sectors.</p>
