                <p>In February 2013, the New York Times' Thomas Friedman made a curious prediction: that Mexico would beat out India and China as "the more dominant economic power in the 21stÂ century".</p>
<p>Descending briefly upon the city of Monterrey, "Mexico's industrial/innovation centre", Friedman determined that, despite prevailing problems involving "drug cartels, crime syndicates, government corruption and weak rule of law", something remarkable had happened: "It's as if Mexicans subconsciously decided that their drug-related violence is a condition to be lived with and combated but not something to define them any longer."</p>
<p>and attendant phenomena such as dismally low wages (phrased more euphemistically, of course).</p>
<p>Never mind that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which came into effect in 1994, has played a crucial role in fuelling not one but all of the problems listed by Friedman - which would seem to hint that his fit of neoliberal ecstasy was perhaps a tad out of place.</p>
<p>'Free trade'</p>
<p>In a new book called A Narco History: How the United States and Mexico Jointly Created the "Mexican Drug War", Mexican novelist Carmen Boullosa and Pulitzer-Prize winning historian Mike Wallace document NAFTA's passage as an essential godsend for the drug trade, the lucrativeness of which has greatly exacerbated official corruption.</p>
<p>The aftermath of the agreement, the authors note, saw the number of Mexican farmers living in poverty increase by one-third, with two million of them eventually forced to abandon their land.</p>
<p>"Free trade" indeed.</p>
<p>NAFTA didn't create the drug business in Mexico, nor did it single-handedly spawn the calamitous 'Mexican Drug War', which officially commenced in 2006 and in a matter of six years eliminated an estimated 70,000-109,000 people.</p>
<p>And the NAFTA-induced surge in cross-border traffic simplified the "insert[ion of] narcotics into the stream of northward-bound commodities".</p>
<p>Century of war</p>
<p>Obviously, NAFTA didn't create the drug business in Mexico, nor did it single-handedly spawn the calamitous "Mexican Drug War", which officially commenced in 2006 and in a matter of six years eliminated an estimated 70,000-109,000 people.</p>
<p>But it's a prime example of how a century's worth of US policies and cross-border machinations have exacerbated narco-activity under the pretence of curbing it.</p>
<p>Boullosa and Wallace argue that the very denomination "Mexican Drug War" is deceiving given its joint construction by Mexico and its domineering northern neighbour - a process that kicked off in 1914 with the United States' proscription of narcotics and the conversion of the US-Mexico frontier into a natural gateway for illicit substances.</p>
<p>Over the years, US haranguing of Mexican authorities to crack down on narco trafficking ignored the root of the problem - US demand - and produced a succession of seemingly counterproductive effects.</p>
<p>Reported US favouritism towards certain cartels presumably didn't help matters.</p>
<p>Other opportunities for irony also abounded.</p>
<p>Prolonging the fight</p>
<p>Now, 101 years after the US initially declared war on drugs in 1914, youâd think the country might have noticed that itâs not exactly working out.</p>
<p>The US Drug Enforcement Administration, they note, would "be hard-pressed to justify its annual budget of roughly $2.5bn if the legal ground shifted beneath it" towards drug decriminalisation.</p>
<p>Arms manufacturers, too, have made a killing off of the southward flow of weapons, both to the Mexican drug cartels - which are awash in American-made arms - and to the Mexican state, to battle the cartels.</p>
<p>And US security assistance to Mexico wouldnât be complete without lucrative contracts to American firms like Northrop Grumman.</p>
<p>Also rooting for a perpetuation of the status quo, the authors write, is the "mammoth incarceration complex [in the US] that â¦ will likely resist any diminution in the production of felons, its lifeblood".</p>
<p>Fulfilling the dream</p>
<p>The modern "Mexican Drug War", meanwhile, is a misnomer in more ways than one.</p>
<p>Boullosa and Wallace note that when Felipe Calderon, former Mexican president and co-father of the current war, met with US ambassador to Mexico Antonio Garza prior to assuming office in 2006, the ambassador encouraged him in his designs for a full-out showdown with the narcos:</p>
<p>"Indeed [Garza] warned that if Calderon wanted to attract the investments needed to jump-start Mexico's economy, 'foreigners and Mexicans alike had to be reassured that the rule of law would prevail'."</p>
<p>However, if the investor class can be sufficiently distracted by prospects for exploitation in a country in which nearly half the population lives in poverty, Mexico just might fulfil the Friedmanian dream.</p>
<p>Look out, India and China.</p>
