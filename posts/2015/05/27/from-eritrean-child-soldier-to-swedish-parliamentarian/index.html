                <p>Few understand the human toll of this conflict better than 62-year-old Arhe Hamednaca.</p>
<p>He was just 15 years old when, in 1968, he became a child soldier, joining the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF).</p>
<p>Rapes and massacres were routine, and the lowland and coastal regions, where support for independence was at its greatest, felt their full force.</p>
<p>Nine years later, Ethiopia began to violate the agreement.</p>
<p>Related: Exiled Eritreans campaign for freedom of journalists</p>
<p>"When I was 12, the [independence] fighters would come to our villages at night.</p>
<p>"I was moved by it and I used to idolise them," the softly spoken Hamednaca continues.</p>
<p>As part of a cell with other teenagers, he handed out leaflets, delivered messages and bought the fighters items they needed from the markets.</p>
<p>'Hatred filled my heart'</p>
<p>Then the Commandos caught him.</p>
<p>"I didn't think I would make it out alive.</p>
<p>Until this day I remember the pain and the hatred that filled my body and heart."</p>
<p>It was another year before Hamednaca officially joined the fighters.</p>
<p>Related: Q&amp;A: Eritreans escape to torturous Sinai</p>
<p>"So on Easter day 1968, I took off and joined the front line of the revolution.</p>
<p>The next day, the Commandos came for his father.</p>
<p>His voice breaks as he recalls what happened next; how his father was tortured and spent much of the following two years in prison.</p>
<p>I witnessed the Ethiopian and the Commando forces' brutality; they would rape, burn down villages, kill people and bury them collectively.</p>
<p>Arhe Hamednaca, Swedish MP</p>
<p>"I felt that I treated my family, especially my father, unfairly," Hamednaca reflects.</p>
<p>"I was told numerous times that I should go back or they would kill my father and harm my entire family," he continues.</p>
<p>But the things he'd seen as a child soldier only strengthened his will to fight on.</p>
<p>"I witnessed the Ethiopian and the Commando forces' brutality; they would rape, burn down villages, kill people and bury them collectively," he says.</p>
<p>Concerned that the false news would reach his family, he snuck back to his village to reassure them.</p>
<p>The Palestinian connection</p>
<p>It was a time when the tide seemed to be turning in favour of the liberation fighters.</p>
<p>During the 1960s, Ethiopia was able to capitalise on the disunity among Eritreans.</p>
<p>Hamednaca, an Orthodox Christian from the lowland part of Eritrea, explains: "They used to say: The ELF are Arabs and they are trying to include Eritrea with other Arab and Islamic countries.</p>
<p>"The Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], Syria and Iraq supported us financially and provided us with military training," he says.</p>
<p>In turn, the rebels felt a particular bond with the Palestinians.</p>
<p>That served to unite Eritreans, across religious, tribal and regional divides, behind the revolution.</p>
<p>Related: Escaping Eritrea's 'open prison'</p>
<p>Cracks began to emerge within the movement and some members broke away to join the newly formed Eritrean People Liberation Front (EPLF).</p>
<p>Between 1975 and 1977, both groups captured key cities.</p>
<p>But as the Cold War drew to an end and opposition forces within Ethiopia became more powerful, the independence fighters gained the upper hand.</p>
<p>In 1991, EPLF liberated the capital, Asmara.</p>
<p>It took another two years until a UN-led independence referendum - in which 99.8 percent voted in favour - was held.</p>
<p>'I just put down the gun'</p>
<p>Following political disagreements with the ELF leadership, he'd left the front line and the country in 1977.</p>
<p>He headed first to Sudan.</p>
<p>Hamednaca√Ç was the first black person to join the Swedish government in 2004 [Arhe Hamednaca]</p>
<p>"I just put down the machine gun."</p>
<p>"For the first time in my life, I felt like a human being, I felt valued and appreciated," he says.</p>
<p>"I am black, African and an ex-fighter, all of a sudden I am told I have rights," he continues, the sense of wonder still evident in his voice all these years later.</p>
<p>He became active in civil societies and trade unions.</p>
<p>The organisation works with boys and girls whose lives are affected by honour-related social and familial structures to challenge perceptions of women.</p>
<p>How I wished Eritrea could also have this.</p>
<p>Arhe Hamednaca - Swedish MP</p>
<p>In 2004, Hamednaca became a special adviser to√Ç integration and equality minister Jens Orback.</p>
<p>"I was the first black person to join the Swedish government in 2004," he says proudly.</p>
<p>When he was elected as an MP in 2010, it was a bittersweet moment for the former child soldier.</p>
<p>How I wished Eritrea could also have this."</p>
<p>As his home country marks 24 years of independence, the parliamentarian is experiencing mixed emotions.</p>
<p>"I remember all the martyrs and the sacrifices they made.</p>
<p>"We finally have our country.</p>
<p>Hamednaca's father died 10 years ago, and although he saw him when he returned to Eritrea following independence in 1993, he cannot shake the feeling that they simply did not have enough time together.</p>
<p>"I still feel that I needed more time with him.</p>
<p>But in many ways, that impassioned 15-year-old child soldier is still very much alive and fighting for social justice - only now, from a European parliament rather than an Eritrean trench.</p>
