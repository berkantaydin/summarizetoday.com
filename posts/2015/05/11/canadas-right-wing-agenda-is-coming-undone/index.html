                <p>It's a good thing for Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper that he's been out of the country.Â</p>
<p>Last weekend, in an apparent attempt to distance himself from whatever was about to emerge at the trial of disgraced Senator Mike Duffy, the Conservative leader took off for Iraq and Kuwait.</p>
<p>However, to more cynical political observers, the visit was a blatant attempt to win back military support after last year's brutal budget cuts to veterans services and benefits.</p>
<p>All of which gave credence to Liberal leader Justin Trudeau's flip remark during last fall's parliamentary debate on the mission: that Harper was just "trying to whip out our CF-18s and show [ISIL] how big they are".</p>
<p>Promotional reports</p>
<p>That despite the prime minister's office (PMO) receiving at least two separate briefings on security measures prohibiting exactly that.</p>
<p>Nobody in the Canadian Armed Forces had ever previewed them.</p>
<p>In 2012, he was finally repatriated to Canada after pleading guilty in 2010 before a US military tribunal to five war crimes.</p>
<p>Khadr's appearance put the lie to the Harper government myth of the cut-throat, murderous terrorist, the political football they kick around as they play to their base in their terrorists-under-every-bed tactics.</p>
<p>The Harper government, which trots out Khadr as the very scary model of a terrorist, going so far as to bar media access to him, did everything it could to fight his release - as expected.</p>
<p>Social media exploded with Canadians' overwhelmingly favourable reactions to his charisma and humble demeanour, with many remarking on how Khadr's appearance put the lie to the Harper government myth of the cut-throat, murderous terrorist, the political football they kick around as they play to their base in their terrorists-under-every-bed tactics.</p>
<p>The week grew worse still.</p>
<p>Damaging revelations</p>
<p>Damaging evidence was being produced in the Ottawa courtroom where Duffy, a former Canadian TV star, is facing 31 charges of bribery, breach of trust and fraud related to his living and travel expenses.</p>
<p>Conservative MPs were called to testify that taxpayers were subsidising party fundraising efforts by flying Duffy around the country.</p>
<p>"This is pure Richard Nixon," charged opposition leader Tom Mulcair of the New Democratic Party (NDP).</p>
<p>To those following the trial, it now seems most unlikely that Harper can continue to profess ignorance of the goings-on in his own party, not to mention his office, related to the Duffy scandal.</p>
<p>Probably the week's most stinging blow came from Harper's home province of Alberta where, on Tuesday, in a stunning election upset, the provincial NDP won a majority, toppling a 44-year reign by the Conservatives.</p>
<p>Only winning an international hockey game would make Canadians more jubilant than they were on Twitter on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>'Albertastan'</p>
<p>Resource sector shares immediately dropped.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, while Harper was not yet back from celebrating VE Day in Holland, federal Justice Minister Peter MacKay emerged from the Conservative caucus room in Ottawa to a media scrum.</p>
<p>Asked what the mood inside was like, he replied: "It was more like a morgue.Â Someone said it was like - it's Albertastan now."</p>
<p>Whether an NDP win in Alberta signals a Conservative defeat in Canada is fodder for the analysts.</p>
<p>When the prime minister returns from his travels, he may find that the political chickens have come home to roost.</p>
