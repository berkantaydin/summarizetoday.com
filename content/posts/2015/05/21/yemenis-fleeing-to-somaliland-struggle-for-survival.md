Hargeisa, Somaliland - When Nadia*,25, arrived at Berbera Port in early May after a nauseating and protracted 30 hours at sea, she knew nothing about the country where she would be landing.

"I didn't even know where Hargeisa or Somaliland was," said the young woman, who used to work as a civil servant in Sanaa.

But this didn't stop her, her mother and three sisters from shelling out the $100 a person to make the journey from conflict-ridden Yemen across the Gulf of Aden.

It is here, in the self-declared autonomous nation of Somaliland, which the international community still considers a part of greater Somalia, that Nadia and part of her family are now picking up the pieces after fleeing an escalating war in Yemen.

Following a recent five-day humanitarian ceasefire, hopes that it would last have been dashed as the bombing campaign continued.

The Houthis, allied with military forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, are also facing fierce resistance from local militias, known as popular resistance committees, in the country's southern and eastern regions where fighters are also vying to blunt the Houthi offensive.

Aid agencies and government officials worry this could further strain nations accepting the Middle East's newest round of refugees.

A third of those are arriving in Somaliland and Puntland, a semi-autonomous north eastern Somali region.

A vast majority of arrivals are considered "returnees" since they hold Somali citizenship.

In the absence of economic and physical capacity of Somaliland's government - and aid agencies that have complained to government officials of their tightening budgets - the burden of assisting those fleeing Yemen's war is largely falling on local communities.

"A lot of organisations are assuming that communities will support the returnees," said Hussein Mohamed Osman, the Berbera Branch Secretary for the Somaliland Red Crescent Society.

There is a [government] commitment to welcome [Yemeni refugees].

The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) is providing financial support to cover transport expenses for returnees from Berbera Port to their place of origin but both government officials and aid workers, speaking on condition of anonymity, have told Al Jazeera that this response is limited in comparison to the overwhelming needs of the refugees.

She told the young woman to go to Somaliland.

Nadia did find Yemenis in Hargeisa, Somaliland's capital, who are offering help.

"There is no embassy, no consul for Yemenis here," said Hussam Al-Eyashi, the chairman of the Yemeni Community Center in Hargeisa.

The Yemeni Community Center has a nascent presence in Hargeisa.

The community centre was meant to assist Yemenis in Somaliland - many of whom are business men.

Relying on charitable donations from community members, the centre officials say they are doing their best to lend a hand.

Locals are scrambling to fill this gap in services.

"There is a [government] commitment to welcome them.

"You already see some begging on the streets," said Saed.

It already grapples with its own staggering unemployment rates - 75 percent among youth.

A Yemeni businessman has offered to pay a small home for Nadia and her family for two months.

Asked if they thought they would be able to find jobs to support themselves, Nadia replied, "We will do our best."
