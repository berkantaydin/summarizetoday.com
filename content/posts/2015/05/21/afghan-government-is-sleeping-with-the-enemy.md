The inking of an intelligence cooperation accord between Afghanistan and Pakistan has raised growing voices of concern at all levels in Afghanistan.

Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security (NDS) and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) have signed a memorandum of understanding which - according to the Afghan Presidential Palace - is aimed "mostly [at] jointly fighting terrorism".

Expressing his deep concerns about the signing of the agreement, former Afghan President Hamid Karzai in a statement called on the government to "immediately cancel" the MoU.

The Afghan National Unity Government's naive overture towards Islamabad seems to be gradually subduing Afghanistan to Pakistan.

My enemy's enemy?

Rejected by Kabul, Afghan and Pakistani media reports suggest that in accordance with the agreement, the ISI will "equip the NDS and train its personnel".

The agreement will also allow Pakistan intelligence agencies to probe the terrorist suspects under Afghan detention.

Who is our joint enemy?

For over a decade, Afghan security forces are fighting an imposed war with Pakistan's deep-state's 'strategic assets' such as the Taliban and the Haqqani Network.

Since the fall of the Taliban regime, the Afghan intelligence establishment has been countering ISI's covert activities in Afghanistan.

All the terrorist groups committing violence in Afghanistan on a daily basis by killing innocent Afghans are believed to have their safe-havens in Pakistan and enjoy unbridled support of the host country's army and intelligence agencies.

Speaking to the upper house of the Afghan parliament recently, the Afghan national security advisor said terrorist hideouts located in Pakistan still pose a "serious threat" to Afghanistan's peace and stability and "our main demand" from Pakistan is to eliminate them.

If Pakistan's interpretation of the term "enemy intelligence agencies" is India, it must accept that India is Afghanistan's friend and ally.

Pakistan's self-destructive policies

Innocent Pakistanis are getting killed in terrorist attacks in different parts of the country every day.

Islamabad must step away from its narrative of denial.

The element of "joint fight against separatism and separatist groups" in the signed MoU is the most worrying part of the agreement.

Under the banner of jointly fighting "separatism and separatist movements", Pakistan's intelligence agency has a hidden strategy, which could be very hazardous for Afghanistan.

What is to be done?

The Afghan government's policy of appeasement towards Islamabad is a one-sided concession to Pakistan's military establishment.

During his visit to Kabul, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced that "capacity building of Afghan police will be done as already offered, including training".

Afghans see no visible change in Pakistan's double-sided policy towards Afghanistan nor in its dealing with terrorist groups.

The head of the Afghan National Directorate of Security, Rahmatullah Nabil, has already expressed his disagreement to the ARG (Afghan Presidential Palace) and resisted the signing of the accord.

It is imperative for the Afghan government to immediately cancel the MoU with Pakistan before the issue leads to a national outcry.
