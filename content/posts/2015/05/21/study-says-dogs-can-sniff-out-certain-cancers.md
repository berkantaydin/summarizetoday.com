Researchers in the UK have found that dogs can detect a number of cancers with a success rate of 90 percent.

Al Jazeera's Emma Hayward said the dogs were being trained toÂ identify odours associated with cancer in urine samples.

"Researchers hope this method could help diagnose cancers in their early stages - avoiding some other invasive methods of screening," our correspondent said.

More research is now set to be carried out.

"Once we've got that evidence that we can screen thousands of samples reliably, then we could offer something tangible to the medical profession," saidÂ Dr Claire Guest, co-founder of the Medical Detection Dogs Charity.
