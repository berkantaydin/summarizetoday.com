In Bhopal, India, the heat is too much for the fruit bat population.

As the thermometer recorded 45C on Tuesday, just one short of the all-time record, the unlucky beasts dropped from the trees, while the wiser ones belly-flopped into Upper Lake, to cool off.

In the major El Nino spring of 1998, India broke heat records on a daily basis.

Now, in this developing El Nino year, India is again suffering from searing heat.

Newspapers are reporting 48C in some places around the city making an unofficial new record high for Nagpur.

As New Delhi hit 43C, a rare thunderstorm cooled things down, but also brought in a dust storm.

This week, thunderstorms have become rare and the heat has set in, with no relief from the burning sun, over most of India.

Diving into rivers, lakes and even water barrels has been the solution for many humans and animals.

Unfortunately this rain also brings up the humidity.

This makes the heat bearable.

With a highly agro-centric economy, India depends on the annual rains, and this building, preceding, heat wave is a consequence that must be borne.
