If ignored, instability in Macedonia could have larger geo-political ramifications for the region.

The current government, led by Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, is mired in a mass wiretapping scandal.

The origins of the leaked wiretappings remains disputed.

The government claims the wiretappings were part of an attempted coup d'etat by the main opposition political party led by Zoran Zaev.

Back in January, a former head of Macedonia's Administration for Security and Counterintelligence (known by its Macedonian acronym UBK), Zoran Verusevski, was arrested and charged with organising a rogue spy ring and then handing the tapes over to the opposition.

Confusion and conspiracy

He too has been charged with conspiring to overthrow the government.Â

Regardless of their origin, it is clear that the scandalous contents of the recordings have been used for political and blackmail purposes by the opposition.

There are also those who claim that the deadly attack on Kumanovo was a false flag operation by the government designed to distract the public from the wiretapping scandal.

An inconvenient truth for the opposition is that Gruevski's electoral mandate is solid.

In order to facilitate political dialogue between the government and opposition, the interior minister, transport and communications minister, and the head of the UBK have resigned - even though they do not admit to any wrong doing.

Gruevski has also agreed to talks in Strasbourg with opposition parties mediated by the European Parliament.

Some protesters have even established makeshift camps vowing to stay until Gruevski resigns.

Free and fair elections

In all three elections he won the support of the Macedonian voters alongside his ethnic Albanian coalition partners.

The Organization and Security and Cooperation Europe (OSCE) said that the elections: "â¦were efficiently administered, including on election day.

There were also more than 2,500 international observers on the ground during the voting process.

Obviously, Zaev and his party cannot fulfil this important function by boycotting parliament.

Many of Macedonia's political problems have their origins in Greece's incessant veto over Skopje's entry into Euro-Atlantic structures due to a dispute over the use of Macedonia's constitutional name.

Euro-Atlantic limbo

Yes, you read it correctly: Greece, a country so dependent on the financial goodwill of its European neighbours, is blocking Macedonia's aspirations to join the EU and NATO because of a name dispute.

Thanks to Greek nationalism and double dealing in negotiations, Macedonia is left in a permanent state of Euro-Atlantic limbo.

No government is perfect.

For its part the government should launch a parliamentary inquiry into the wiretapping and ensure that the judicial process works in a transparent way.

In any democracy, peaceful protests are a sign of a healthy civil society.
