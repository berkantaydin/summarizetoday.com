Forward LeBron James made a baseline jump shot as time expired to lift the Cleveland Cavaliers to an 86-84 win against the Chicago Bulls in Game Four of their Eastern Conference semi-final playoff series.

James finished with 25 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists as the Cavaliers evened the best-of-seven series at two games apiece ahead of Game Five in Cleveland on Tuesday.

Teammates mobbed James after he drilled the shot from 21 feet along the left baseline.

In Game Three, Rose banked in a three-pointer as time expired to win the game.

Guard J.R. Smith sparked the turnaround with a trio of three-pointers early in the fourth quarter.

Center Timofey Mozgov contributed 15 points and nine rebounds for Cleveland.
