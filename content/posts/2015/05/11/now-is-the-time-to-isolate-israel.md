The make-up of his new coalition government highlights the hollowness of his post-election backtracking from that statement amid international uproar - not that anyone was fooled by it.

Arguably the most right-wing, extremist government in Israel's history - and that is saying something - consists of five parties: Likud, Jewish Home, United Torah Judaism, Shas and Kulanu.

These conditions include Israel keeping East Jerusalem, being recognised as a Jewish state, and keeping the largest settlement blocs, which are built on the West Bank's water aquifers and most fertile land, and hinder the territorial contiguity of a Palestinian state.

That state, meanwhile, would have to be demilitarised and renounce the rights of Palestinian refugees.

Major concessions

Indeed, none of the coalition partners accept a freeze on settlement activity in the occupied Palestinian territories, which is illegal under international law.

Without its backing, Israel's president would have tasked another MP - likely Isaac Herzog, leader of the opposition Zionist Union, the second-largest party in parliament - with forming a government.

Jewish Home will "take several key portfolios, including justice and education, as well as control of the World Zionist Organization's settlement division, which transfers money to settlements," AFP newswire reported.

Had the new Israeli government been more centrist or left-leaning, the international community would be giving it the benefit of the doubt, forgetting that every Israeli government ... has enthusiastically entrenched the occupation and colonisation of Palestine.

"The party will have two seats in the security cabinet," which makes critical decisions regarding war and peace, "and the position of deputy defence minister, with responsibility for the Civil Administration that runs civilian affairs in most of the occupied West Bank".

Kulanu leader Moshe Kahlon is expected to become finance minister and serve in the security cabinet.

If he and his colleagues do not deem the pliant Palestinian Authority and its President Mahmoud Abbas as worthy of talking to, then no one on the Palestinian side will ever be - in other words, forget indefinitely about a Palestinian state.

Silver lining

Amid such gloomy prospects lies an opportunity for the Palestinians.

As such, the Palestinians and their supporters should capitalise on what will likely be Israel's growing international isolation, even among its allies.

The Authority may feel that the time is right to renew its bid for a UN Security Council resolution setting a deadline for the end of Israel's occupation.

The first attempt failed because of US lobbying and the threat of its veto.

If another attempt was successful, Israel would ignore it - as it has done with countless other UN resolutions - but this would only add to its pariah status.

This will result in punitive Israeli measures, but an unashamedly extremist government will have less diplomatic backing.

Israel's flagrant rejection of an independent Palestine may also galvanise the movement for a single binational state.

Ironically, those Israeli politicians most vehemently against a Palestinian state may be bringing about their worst nightmare: A binational state with equality of citizenry, rather than the Jewish ethnocracy/theocracy that currently exists and which they want to entrench.

The contrary may be true if the Palestinians and their supporters can turn Israel's intransigence and obstructionism - personified by its new government - into an opportunity.
