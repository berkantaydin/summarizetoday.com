A year ago, Thailand's army, headed by General Prayuth Chan-ocha overthrew the government of Yingluck Shinawatra.

But the most fearful thing is that we'll never return to where we actually wereâ¦ And we have to wait a long time, I guess, until those legislations could be amended again.

Pirongrong Ramasoota, Director, Thai Media Policy Center

It was the 12th military coup in a country that has had the most coups in the world since the beginning of the 20th century.

For Thailand's media, reporting in such a politically charged environment has always been a challenge, and the lifting of martial law in April has not done anything to ease the pressure.

The country is still governed by the army's NCPO - the National Council for Peace and Order - and in place of martial law is Article 44, a so-called security law that journalists, human rights activists and political observers say has elements that are even more stringent than martial law.

The NCPO have the power to pull news reports off the air, tell editors not to publish articles and restrict online content if they feel the nation could be endangered.

For the country's journalists, Article 44 has serious implications but in addition, there is the challenge of reporting on the General-turned-Prime-Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha.

The military man has made clear he wants a media that quote "works together for the good of the nation" unquote - and he will be the one to decide what constitutes the good of the nation.
