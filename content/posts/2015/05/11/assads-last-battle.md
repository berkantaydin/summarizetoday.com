The long-planned spring battle of Qalamoun - between Hezbollah and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces on one hand, and Syrian rebels on the other hand - started last weekend.

It is a vital supply line between Syrian and Lebanese territory, at a tactical proximity of the M5 Damascus-Aleppo highway.

In addition, it would significantly curb Hezbollah'sÂ ability to provide logistical support to the regime and transport fighters to Syrian territory.

With that in mind, both camps have been reinforcing their positions and scouting this border area to identify targets during the past year, and waiting for the right moment to attack.

Hezbollah has declared the Qalamoun battle an existential one.

The cross-border fighting has significantlyÂ limited the capabilities of Hezbollah to transfer Iranian weapons to Lebanon.

With continuous losses, excessive cost and increasing casualties in Syria, Hezbollah has been gradually withdrawing towards the border area.

If Hezbollah does not win this battle, it will soonÂ lose its direct and easy access to Syrian soil.

Similarly, al-Nusra Front, the strongest emerging entity in the Syrian conflict in the past year, will not give up on the Qalamoun front, and has been mobilising Sunnis.

Nusra has been investing in Lebanese Sunni neighbourhoods, border towns and refugee communities to generate more support for its anti-Assad campaign and anti-Hezbollah intervention in Syria.

In the past two weeks, a clear message has been spread to encourage young Sunnis and refugees in Lebanon to join the fight - notably by sending mobile phone messages rallying support for the group.

This is being done with an aim to better coordinate their defensive operations and offensive manoeuvres.

Recent developments in Syria have encouraged Syrian rebels to cooperate together to replicate the successes they had in Idlib province and Jisr al-Shoughour.

This cooperation gave them an upper hand in the fight against Assad and his allies for the first time since the beginning of the conflict.

As a matter of fact, residual ISIL fighters in Qalamoun initiated skirmishes against Free Syrian Army fighters, in an attempt to test their responsive capability and distract them from the main battle with Hezbollah and the regime.

In previous months, ISIL forces on the Qalamoun front were redeployed deep inside Syrian territory and in Iraq.

Suffering from divested morale among its troops, the Assad regime has been increasingly beenÂ resorting to similar gambits to weaken the opposition.

The Qalamoun battle will not be a classic confrontation to liberate and control border areas.

Setbacks and losses

Assad regime forces and Hezbollah fighters'Â objectives to shock, engulf and invade rebel positions in record time failed.

They have excavated a sophisticated network of caves, underground tunnels and trenches that gave them the capability to ambush and push back any attempt to infiltrate their fortified positions, inflicting heavy losses.

Both Assad regime troops and Hezbollah fighters have reportedly suffered significant losses in the past few days.

This has pushed the Hezbollah leadership to renounce the announcement of the beginning of the Qalamoun offensive in order not to further demoralise their troops due to the first round of casualties, though the operations have already started.

This battle will further damage the survival odds of the Syrian regime, and additionally exhaust Hezbollah's military capabilities.Â
