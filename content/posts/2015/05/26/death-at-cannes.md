The Cannes Film Festival always reflects the vicissitudes of the world.

This year, the official competition line-up only showed two properly political films - that's two out of 19.

Dheepan is a tense film about a Tamil Tiger fighter who flees Sri Lanka with a woman and a young girl.

Apart from Lindon in the leading role, the cast is made up of non-professional actors playing their real-life roles.

Death in all shapes

This year, however, politics were not the overriding concern of directors.

This year, it seems, film directors have been gripped by a more abstract topic.

The darkness of all these film directors' thoughts worked in unison to depict an atmosphere of universal pessimism.

Festival-goers could simply not escape this fate.

Some films were outstanding like the critics' favourite to win the Palme d'Or, Moretti's Mia Madre, whose autobiographical screenplay about the death of his mother, a professor of Latin, while he is busy filming, left film critics in floods of tears; some others were panned and deemed simply ridiculous like Van Sant's Sea of Trees with an American mathematician played by Matthew McConaughey going to Mount Fuji to commit suicide, only to be saved by Japanese spirits.

Universal pessimism

However, the darkness of all these film directors' thoughts worked in unison to depict an atmosphere of universal pessimism.

The Taiwanese director, who had not made a film in eight years, offered the Croisette the only glimmer of hope when his highly trained assassin (the mesmerising actress Chu Qi) struggles to fulfil her contract and kill her target.

A world where redemption has become an old forgotten concept is what the Cannes Film Festival has delivered in 2015.

Let's only hope that next year's vintage will be slightly less depressing and less melancholy, and even more importantly, less resigned in spirit.
