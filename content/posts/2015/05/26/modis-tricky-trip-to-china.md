The trip served as a quid pro quo for Chinese leader Xi Jinping's late-2014 visit to India, which revealed tremendous personal chemistry between the two leaders and paved the way for $20bn in Chinese investment pledges as well as 12 different agreements for cooperation across various fields.

For him, China represented an indispensable economic partner for India.

And partly thanks to economic lessons from and robust economic ties with China, Modi's Gujarat emerged as an economic powerhouse in India, achieving a whopping 10 percent average annual Gross Domestic Product growth from 2001 to 2012.

Quite naturally, this left a largely positive impression on the Indian leader.

Economic stakes

Yet, Modi is also a nationalist, who has not only vowed to defend India's territorial integrity against Chinese designs in the state of Arunachal Pradesh in the Himalayas, but has also increasingly cast away India's long history of non-alignment in favour of closer strategic ties with the United States and Japan.Â And this may explain why Modi chose Tokyo and Washington as his first major foreign trips before going to Beijing this year.

Just like Xi's festive visit to India last year, Modi also put some personal touchesÂ to his diplomatic charm offensive in China, including a widely coveredÂ "selfie" picture with his Chinese counterpart, Li Keqiang.

The state-run China Daily reported that Xi requested for "highest-level reception"Â for his Indian guest, underscoring Beijing's intent on projecting a special spirit of comradery between the two Asian giants.

The Indian leader was intent on securing maximum economic benefits from the trip.

Modi sought China to leverage its vast financial resources to help India address its $1 trillion infrastructure spending needs.

So Modi isn't going home empty-handed, though India surely expects even greater economic commitment from China.

The elephant in the room, however, is the Sino-Indian 4,000km-long disputed border in the Himalayas, the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which sparked a brief and bitter war back in 1962 - and has since embittered bilateral relations.

For optimists, however, there are two reasons to look forward to a potential thaw in bilateral territorial disputes.

Modi enjoys unparalleled popularity at home, and hardly anyone can accuse the charismatic Indian leader of lacking patriotism and foreign policy vigour.

Second, China's festering maritime disputes with its neighbours along the East and South China Seas, which has drawn US naval muscle in, may encourage Beijing to dial down border tensions with India in order to avoid full encirclement.

While India has pushed ahead with fortifying its position in disputed borders, China has also shown little appetite for compromise.

Last year, Xi's visit to India coincided with a dangerous escalation along the LAC, as People's Liberation Army forces reasserted China's claim in the area.

Beijing has also been irked by Modi's decision to move closer to Washington and Tokyo, with India more explicitly and consistently criticising China's maritime assertiveness in South China Sea in recent years.

Overall, Modi's trip to China paved the way for sufficient diplomatic rapport and economic interdependence to avoid a full estrangement between the two giant neighbours.
