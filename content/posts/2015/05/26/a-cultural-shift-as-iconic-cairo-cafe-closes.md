With the death earlier this month of Cafe Riche's proprietor, Magdy Abdel-Malak, downtown Cairo's most famous intellectual salon has shut its doors once againÂ - this time, possibly permanently.

By so doing, it has gone from a place where significant chapters of Egypt's modern political, intellectual, cultural and social history were written to become an iconic footnote in the country's tumultuous modern history.

Though its dated glass-and-wood exterior is unremarkable to the 21st-century passer-by in the city of a thousand minarets and a cafe on every corner, Riche was at the throbbing heart of Egypt's intellectual and political life for the greater part of the 20thÂ century.

Riche dates back to what many Egyptians regard as Cairo's belle epoque.

Cairo's belle epoque

Just as Khedive Ismail had intended his new European-style capital to be a "Paris on the Nile" - almost bankrupting Egypt in the process - Cafe Riche was modelled on its Parisian namesake.

Open from 1785 to 1915, the French Cafe Riche was frequented by some of Paris' literary and intellectual giants, including legendary writers Alexandre Dumas and Emile Zola, of "J'accuse" fame.

He set up a theatre there that soon become one of the most well-known performance spaces in town.

The Cairo in which Riche established its glory was a dizzying city of bewildering contrasts and contradictions.

An elitist playground for pashas and the nobility, its streets teemed with high-born and minority socialist and nationalist revolutionaries, including a number who barely spoke Arabic.

While well-to-do customers enjoyed the singing skills of the likes of then pro-royalist new talent Umm Kalthoum - who later became the legendary "Star of the Orient" - anti-British agitators printed pamphlets for the 1919 revolution in the cafe's basement.

In 1919, a young medical student sat patiently in wait of Prime Minister YoussefÂ Wahba, who was a Riche regular, and as his car approached the young radical attempted but failed to assassinate him.

Different generation

Back then, revolutionaries clashing with the British sometimes sought shelter inside Riche, which became a regular target of police raids.

It is reputed that Gamal Abdel-Nasser and his fellow Free Officers partly planned the 1952 revolution in Riche - though other downtown political cafes also claim that honour.

At first, the army's coup gave a shot in the arm to Egypt's native leftist and liberal intellectuals, revolutionaries and writers, including Nobel laureate Naguib Mahfouz, who held his literary court there for many years.

But these artists and intellectuals soon discovered that Egypt's management had changed but its tolerance of free thought and dissent had not.

Riche, like downtown Cairo, entered a period of long decline.

Period of decline

With nowhere left to gather, secular youth either went underground or fell into the cynical arms of apathy, while others rushed into the comforting embrace of Islamist certitude.

This led to a period of intellectual and political navel-gazing in which Riche became the "whole world", in the words of poet Naguib Sorour, for the dwindling ranks of its oft-hard-drinking punters, for whom Sorour drafted a tongue-in-cheek "Protocols of the Wise Men of Riche".

Naguib Mahfouz's introspective 1983 novel "The Day the Leader was Killed"Â is partly set in Cafe Riche - which is described as a "refuge from the pain of loneliness" - and explores, through the allegory of numerous narratives, the theme of where Egypt's post-independence experiment went wrong.

In 1990, Cafe Riche closed under mysterious circumstances and was seriously damaged by the 1992 earthquake.

At the birth of the new millennium, I attended its reopening a decade later, during an art festival designed to revive downtown's downtrodden cultural scene.

Famed irreverence

As if to show he still possessed his famed irreverence, he read from his poem "Long live the people of my country" in which he ridiculed what he perceived as the empty rhetoric and detachment from reality of the Richesque, their impotence, and the ease and smugness with which they formulated glib solutions to the country's woes.

Like Negm himself, the nouveau Riche was a poor imitation, even a parody of its former self.

At the time, I wondered in an article whether Riche would be able to resurrect its spirit and not just its ghost.

Despite its rich history, or because of it, Riche managed to pull in far more tourists than members of the young and re-energised intelligentsia, apart from briefly during the revolution.

The young and creative have returned in droves in recent years, intent on reviving and reinventing Cairo's heart.
