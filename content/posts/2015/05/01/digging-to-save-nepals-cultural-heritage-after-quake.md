Bhaktapur, Nepal - Young men stood on the ruins of a temple in Bhaktapur's old city digging vigorously in the dirt and rubble with bare hands and shovels.

Whenever they unearthed a large stone carving on Thursday afternoon, others quickly crowded around to help lift out the heavy object.

The death toll reached 6,260 on Friday .

Many of the monuments and temples in Kathmandu Valley, which was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979, for seven distinct locations, were destroyed in the earthquake.

Parts of Changu Narayan, a majestic ancient hilltop Hindu complex, lies in isolated ruins.

According to Alok Tuladhar, a cultural heritage documentarian and an expert in the heritage of Kathmandu's Durbar Square, an informal meeting called for by UNESCO was held on Thursday with various cultural experts, and even included a French archaeologist who happened to be doing fieldwork in Nepal during the earthquake, to discuss how to assess the destruction.

"We've all decided to form a national coordination unit to do a field assessment," Tuladhar said.

Tech-driven salvage

There are immediate plans to start training the country's young architects, archaeologists, artists and art historians on how to assess the damage.

Most of the heritage sites that were destroyed date back to the medieval period, said Tuladhar, while others were built as recently as 150 years ago, and the ancient sites are as old as 4,000 years.

Nepal's monuments are not old relics, Tuladhar pointed out, but vital centres for religious, cultural and social activities.

They are "directly linked with a very vibrant, cultural, intangible heritage that we have been able to keep alive."

And many standing structures may need to be torn down after conservation experts inspect them.

Local knowledge vital

The country's cultural loss extends beyond the monuments: Many of these ruined heritage sites include people's homes in places such as Bhaktapur.

Inside Durbar Square, temple security guards were guarding about 150 stone and wooden carvings and brass bells in a courtyard.

Back at Bhagwati Temple, men used a rope to drag stone carvings off the temple's base.

Across Durbar Square people walked about looking at the shattered monuments.

In the alleyways behind Durbar Square, Gyanendra Khaiju, 38, a chess referee wearing a Nepali national chess team tracksuit and a face mask around his neck, walked through the historic neighbourhood he had grown up in.

The neighbours had rented a room, and the other family members were going to one of the many makeshift campsites in Bhaktapur.

Khaiju picked through the streets pointing out the worst-hit places.

Two of Khaiju's middle-aged female neighbours died here.

Khaiju pointed to one entirely intact house, built in the traditional Newari style with a brick facade and a tiled roof attic on the fourth floor.

Many traditional homes were originally designed to withstand earthquakes, built based on knowledge developed over thousands of years by our ancestors, said Tuladhar.

Architectural styles important

The Kumari Ghar, for instance, at Kathmandu's Durbar Square, is one traditional building that suffered little damage.

The lower few floors, which had been built in a traditional Newari architectural design, seemed to have sustained little damage, but the floors above that had been constructed with large concrete slabs had fallen.

He estimates that businesses may reopen in one month.

"The main problem is the mental stress."

Still, Dhoubanzar, whose family survived the earthquake, recognises his relative good fortune.Â

As he sat on a step facing the men clearing Bhagwati Temple, he said the removal of debris provided some relief.
