Demonstrations have taken place around the world as protesters gathered to mark May Day, also known as Labour Day, the annual day when workers take action to demand increased labour rights.

With 80 countries around the world marking May 1 as a public holiday, Istanbul's Taksim Square was in lockdown on Friday, after the Turkish government banned May Day protests there.

Large rallies were held in Europe and across Asia - including in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Cambodia, the Philippines and South Korea - where workers demanded an increase in minimum wages and better living conditions.
