A Baltimore police officer has been charged with the second-degree murder of Freddie Gray, while five other officers will faceÂ criminal charges over hisÂ arrest and death,Â the city's chief prosecutor has said.

Marilyn Mosby,Â Baltimore's state's attorney, said on Friday that all six officers involved in Gray's arrest would faceÂ criminal charges afterÂ failing to provide medical attention to the 25-year-old black man.

Mosby said the Maryland chief medical examiner ruled Gray's death as murder and that his fatal spinal injury occurred while he was riding without restraints in the van.

"Mr. Gray suffered a severe and critical neck injury as a result of being handcuffed, shackled by his feet, and unrestrained inside the BPD [Baltimore Police Department] wagon," Mosby told reporters at a news conference.

Officer Porter then physically assisted Mr. Gray from the floor of the van to the bench.

"The finding of our comprehensive, thorough and independent investigation, coupled with the medical examiners determination is that Mr Gray's death was a homicide," she said.

The driver of the police van, Caesar R Goodson Jr, faced the stiffest charge of second-degree "depraved heart" murder.

The other five officers face charges of involuntary manslaughter, second-degree assault,Â misconduct in office and false imprisonment.

Al Jazeera's Tom Ackerman, reporting from Baltimore, said if convicted Goodson Jr could face up to 30 years in prison.

Mosby also said the switchblade officers accused Gray of illegally carrying was in fact a legal knife, and there was no justification for his arrest.

US President Barack Obama said it was "absolutely vital"Â that the truth about what happened to Freddie Gray came out.

He added that justice needs to be served andÂ the people of Baltimore need the truth.

Gray's death on April 19, a week after his arrest, is the latest flashpoint in a national outcry over the treatment of African-Americans and other minority groups by US law enforcement.

After a night of rioting in Baltimore on Monday, protests spread to other major cities in a reprise of demonstrations last year set off by police killings of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri, New York and elsewhere.
