Two bombs have exploded in the Iraqi capital, killing at least 12 people and injuring 25, Al Jazeera has learnt.

The first bomb detonated in central Baghdad's Bab al-Sharji area near al-Nassir Square around 7.30pm local time, killing at least 10 people and injuring another 18.

An Al Jazeera correspondent in Baghdad said separate police sources said the explosion was caused by a car bomb and a suicide bomber with a vest.

The attack appeared to target Shia visitors on their annual pilgrimage to the shrine of Imam Kadhim.Â

In a second attack in Palestine Street in Baghdad's east, a roadside bomb exploded, killing two people and injuring seven.

Baghdad has been rocked by several car bombs targeting Shia pilgrims in recent weeks.
