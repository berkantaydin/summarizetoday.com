Barcelona's Neymar struck twice to put the Spanish side in the Champions League final despite a 3-2 loss at Bayern Munich as they progressed 5-3 on aggregate and will face Real Madrid or Juventus next month.

The tricky Brazil forward's double in 14 first-half minutes killed off the hosts' slim chances following the Spanish side's 3-0 first-leg win at the Nou Camp last week over their former coach Pep Guardiola's team.

The Spaniards are now one victory away from triumphing in each of the three titles they are chasing including a domestic league and Cup double and the Champions League where they will play in the showpiece game in Berlin on June 6.

Neymar was twice picked out by striker Luis Suarez, after Bayern's seventh-minute lead through Medhi Benatia had briefly reignited the Germans' hopes.

Bayern struck back with second-half goals from Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Mueller but were still left needing another three to qualify for the showpiece match.

Barcelona, into an eighth European Cup final, will make their first appearance since 2011, when they won the trophy under Guardiola.

It was Barca's first Champions League away defeat this term as Bayern ended a four-game losing run in all competitions, but Guardiola's aura of invincibility has been hit after he failed for the second season to reach the final with the German club.
