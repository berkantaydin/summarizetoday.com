This has been a weird week for the Obama administration.

That was clearly the case with the upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) summit.

Getting information about the most basic details in the run-up to the event seemed about the equivalent of asking for the nuclear codes.

We were sitting around the office wondering why they were being so strange this time.

They said King Salman of Saudi Arabia would be at the Camp David summit.

US Secretary of State John Kerry had just been in Saudi Arabia meeting with the king.

The White House press secretary tried his best to spin this as anything but a snub.

He said the "right people will be at the table".

He insisted if the Saudis were sending a message, "it wasn't received."

That begs the wider question why would a longtime ally feel the need to publicly rebuke the US president.

I think that is a complicated answer.

There is the history, many of the leaders made it clear they became suspicious of Obama when he called for the ousting of former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak.

I've spoken to many analysts who say the GCC leaders don't believe the president really understands the region.

They point to what is happening in Iraq, Syria and Libya as proof.

Obama recently chastised Gulf leaders in an interview, saying they should be more worried about their populations revolting than Iran attacking.

The countries concerned always say the big fear is that if Iran got a nuclear weapon they would use it against them.

I think the premise of that concern needs to be debated.

Would the leaders of Iran actually bomb Israel, for example, knowing that the response could lead to their entire country being wiped off the map?

The analysts I've talked to say the GCC countries have near-term and long-term concerns.

In the short term, if the deal is reached then sanctions are lifted.

If Iranâs economy recovers, Tehran will have more money to fund the proxies that it supports in the regional conflicts.

That makes it much more complicated.

The long-term concern is that Iran could again become the go to US ally in the region.

So that brings us to today.

The Gulf countries could ask for a much stronger defence treaty.

It's hard to see how that would pass if Israel is at all opposed to a new stronger treaty.

The other possibility, give them better weapons systems.

The president might want to do that but again he can't do that without Congress.

The last option, Obama could stop negotiating with Iran.

The kings of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia will send their surrogates and send a message.

The president for his part isn't likely to change what he's doing, or what he's willing to give them, in return for their support.
