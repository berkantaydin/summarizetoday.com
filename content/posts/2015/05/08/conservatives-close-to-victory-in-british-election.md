British Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative Party looks set to continue in power, with projections and seats already announced giving his party a majority.

The results seem to confirm a shock exit poll projection published by British broadcasters late on Thursday night that put the party way ahead of the opposition Labour Party with 316 seats.

The poll also predicted Labour winning 239 seats, the Scottish National Party (SNP) winning 58 and the Liberal Democrats winning 10.

Speaking after successfully defending his seat in Witney, Cameron said his Conservative party's policies in the last government had been vindicated by the result.

"This has been a very strong night for the Conservative Party," the prime minister said.

"Some people say there's only one opinion poll that counts and that's the one on election day, and I don't think that's ever been truer than tonight," he added, referring to polls published before election day that had put his party neck and neck with Labour.

A party needs 326 seats to achieve a majority in parliament, but this number is slightly lower in practice, as the Sinn Fein MPs in Northern Ireland do not take up their seats.

Labour leader Ed Miliband, speaking after he retained his Doncaster North seat, said he was "disappointed" in the result.

"It's clearly been a very disappointing and difficult night for the Labour Party.

"I am deeply sorry for what has happened."

Al Jazeera's Laurence Lee, reporting from Westminster palace in London, said the scale at which the opinion polls had failed to predict the result had been unprecedented.

"What's turning out to be the result of this is an extremely divided election, and a potentially very disunited kingdom," he said.

"The big winners, the SNP in Scotland...the big losers are the Labour Party, who are now in a real mess, and the Liberal Democracts."

In Scotland, the nationalist SNP has taken a near clean sweep of seats in the region, picking up 56 of 59 seats.

The gains came at the expense of the Labour and the Liberal Democrats, which were reduced to just one seat each.

Labour lost 40 seats in Scotland and saw its regional head, Jim Murphy, and shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander lose their seats.

Danny Alexander, theÂ Liberal Democrat minister,Â also lost in his own constituency.

The SNP went into the elections with just six seats from 2010.

The party's leader, Nicola Sturgeon, who was not standing herself celebrated the result, after initially urging caution over the exit poll projection.

"Thanks so much to everyone who voted SNP today.

A number of prominent MPs, including current ministers and senior leaders from across the political spectrum, have lost their seats.

The party's former leader, Charles Kennedy, lost his seat to the SNP, and ministers Vince Cable and Simon Hughes also lost in their constituencies.

The party's leader, Nick Clegg, who retained his seat, said he would comment on his future later on Friday morning.

Former Liberal Democrat leader Ming Campbell told Al Jazeera the party would have to "start from the bottom up".

George Galloway, a former Labour MP and leader of Respect party,Â lost to Labour's Naz Shah in Bradford West, a seat he was widely expected to retain.

The Conservative Employment Minister Esther McVey lost her seat in Wirral West to Labour.

Labour's shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, was also defeated by Conservative candidate Andrea Jenkyns

In Wales, the nationalist Plaid Cymru held its three seats, and in England the right-wing UK Independence Party is expected to pick up two seats, despite gaining around 12 percent of the votes cast.

The Green Party's Caroline Lucas is expected to hold its only seat.Â
