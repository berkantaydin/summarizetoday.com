On Tuesday, an Al Jazeera journalist received a phone call from a man who said he was stuck on a plastic boat in the Mediterranean.

The man said that the boat was carrying about 100 people, was flooding with sea water and that those on board - men, women and children - needed to be rescued immediately.

One activist sent an SOS.

We have yet to receive confirmation that the people in the boat have been rescued.

Below is an edited transcript of a conversation with the man in which he describes a terrifying situation for those on board as they use a sattellite phone to find help.

Al Jazeera: Is help now on the way?

Migrant: The Italian Coastguard have contacted me but they have still not come here, they said in at least 40 minutes we will get to you.

Al Jazeera: Where did you leave from?Â

Migrant: We left from Tripoli three days ago and we are going to Italy.

Al Jazeera: What is the condition of the boat?

Itâs a plastic boat.Â

Al Jazeera: Who are the people on board?

Migrant: We are Somali immigrants.

Al Jazeera: What supplies do you have?

Migrant: We have only two plastic bags full of drinking water left and one kilo of food, thereâs nothing else.

Al Jazeera: Do you know where you are at the moment?

I have a GPS and I think we are near Italy but I donât know exactly â¦ I only have the GPS location (coordinates).

Al Jazeera: Who is in charge of the boat?

Migrant: Iâm not in charge of the boat.

Al Jazeera: How are people on the boat feeling?

They donât know where they are going and canât go back where they left from.Â

If you talk to the Italians, tell them to help us.
