The five-day ceasefire in Yemen will allow the delivery of much-needed aid to millions of people.

Saudi Arabia says the truce might be extended if the process of delivering humanitarian aid is successful and if the Houthis do not engage in any attacks.

There are also hopes the break in the fighting might pave the way for all sides to reach a political deal.

And is Yemen facing further unrest?
