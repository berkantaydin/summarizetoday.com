More than 100 defendants, including former President Mohamed Morsi, were sentenced to death in an Egyptian court this weekend over a mass prison break in 2011.

Among those sentenced in absentia was Egyptian political scientist Emad Shahin, a visiting professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service.

Al Jazeera spoke with Shahin about the implications of Saturday's verdict, along with the state of political and academic freedom in the country.

OPINION:Â Death sentence for freedom in Egypt

Al Jazeera: What was your reaction to this verdict, and what does it say about the current state of affairs in Egypt?

But I thought it was excessive.

It's a message of intimidation - sort of state terrorism - against opponents, against defendants, anyone who dares to express some kind of opposition and dissent to the military coup.

If there are death sentences against politicians in highly politicised, highly fabricated cases, and then the regime is subjected to outside pressure and [President Abdel Fattah] el-Sisi commutes these sentences to life in prison, then he appears benevolent and merciful and responsive to appeals.

How would you describe the state of academic freedom in Egypt today?

I know so many cases of instructions to academics not to address certain issues, especially with regards to civil-military relations.

The judiciary as part of the deep state is helping them to do so and is settling accounts with the Muslim Brothers and the activists of the January 25, 2011, revolution.

Al Jazeera: What would you say to scholars who have expressed solidarity with you, and is there any way to build on that solidarity campaign now?

The momentum needs to continue.

There is an immediate need to take firm actions to stop human rights violations in Egypt.

Al Jazeera: Hundreds of people have been sentenced to death since Sisi took power.

He created that problem.

We're really in the bottom, and some people are still trying to go through another six decades of military rule.

Once we have been through a clear failure, we have to change course and allow for a democratic system to emerge, and the minimum requirements of good governance to flourish in Egypt: accountability, transparency, participation, rule of law.

Al Jazeera: How would you characterise Egypt's current political leadership?

He doesn't want elections or a parliament to restrict his authorities.

And that's what actually helps some countries in the transformation from military rule to democratic, civilian rule.

Al Jazeera: With regards to your case, what do you foresee will happen after it is sent to the grand mufti?

Shahin: I really don't know.

I can't go back to Egypt under these circumstances.
