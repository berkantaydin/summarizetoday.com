Over the past month, an estimated 10,000 families have fled their homesÂ because ofÂ fierce fighting in Afghanistan's northern Kunduz province.Â The number ofÂ emergencyÂ camps has increased dramatically as Taliban fighters occupy homes and take over villages.Â PeopleÂ in the campsÂ complain they are not getting enough support from the government.
