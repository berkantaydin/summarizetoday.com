Egypt has executed six members of an armed group with links to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant for carrying out an attack on soldiers near the capital, Cairo, last year.

On Saturday, an Egyptian court sentenced to death former President Mohamed Morsi and more than 100 supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood.

This was the latest in a series of such verdicts in the country since the military overthrew Morsi almost two years ago.

Now, the judiciary stands accused of being a political tool in the hands of the military.

But would the crackdown backfire?
