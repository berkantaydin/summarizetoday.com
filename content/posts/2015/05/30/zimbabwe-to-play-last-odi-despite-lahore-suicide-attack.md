The Pakistan Cricket Board has said that Zimbabwe will play the last ODI of their tour of Pakistan despite a suicide blast near Gaddafi Stadium Lahore that killed one sub-inspector and one civilian while injuring several others on Friday.

Zimbabwe are the first Test nation to tour Pakistan since the attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in March 2009.

Described initially as an electricity transformer blast by police, it was later confirmed as a suicide attack.

"The incident happened away from the main premises and nothing is affected," a PCB spokesman told the ESPNcricinfo website.

They will play the third match on Sunday and subsequently will fly back in the wee hours of Monday."

A Capital City Police Officer confirmed that security has been "beefed up" following the attack.

"We have the resolve and the capacity to provide full security to the honourable members of the Zimbabwe team," he added.

"They are heroes, we treat them like heroes.

Zimbabwe lost the two-match Twenty20 series earlier and the hosts have taken an unassailable 2-0 lead in the ODI series as well.
