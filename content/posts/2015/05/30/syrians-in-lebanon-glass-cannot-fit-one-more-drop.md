Beirut - Nour is 20 and has nothing.

Her husband disappeared more than two years ago.

Nour hoped to be registered as a refugee by UNHCR in order to obtain a bit of assistance, but a few days before her appointment date this month, she was informed that her appointment had been cancelled.

Thousands of Syrians are in her same situation after UNHCR stopped registering Syrian refugees in Lebanon in early May, responding to a request from the Lebanese government, which is aiming to restrict the presence of Syrians in the country.Â As a result, newly arriving Syrian refugees will be unable to access international assistance and protection, making them even more vulnerable.

"UNHCR works in countries around the world with the permission of the government, so we cannot ignore a direct order from the government,"Â UNHCR's representative in Lebanon, Ninette Kelley, told Al Jazeera.

Since border restrictions have been put in place, far fewer refugees are coming into Lebanon through official borders.

Those discussions are still ongoing, she said, but for now, non-registered Syrians cannot access the benefits associated with registration, including health services, shelter support and legal advice, as well as the possibility to apply for resettlement.Â

"We hope this is a temporary decision.

"Now we have 1.2 million [refugees].

The situation has provoked social, economic and political challenges, amid increasing pressure on the country's resources.

"The government took a decision last October that included new border measures for all Syrians and also asked [UNHCR] to stop registering refugees unless in very exceptional humanitarian cases.

Alternatively, Syrians can get a Lebanese sponsor.

An NGO officer working in registration, who asked to remain anonymous, told Al Jazeera: "Since these categories came into effect, most Syrians I've met entered with [a] tourism visa."

But the number of non-registered Syrians in Lebanon who would be affected by the latest measure is even bigger, humanitarian workers say.

A total of 1,471 people were affected by the order, losing their benefits.

Once a wealthy branch manager in Hasaka, Chadi lost everything during the war and says his savings will only last four more months.

Several humanitarian groups say the number of refugees residing in the country illegally has increased dramatically, as many Syrians enter Lebanon through unofficial border crossings.

"Since border restrictions have been put in place, far fewer refugees are coming into Lebanon through official borders," Kelley said.
