Britainâs Amir Khan took a unanimous decision victory over American Chris Algieri in a welterweight matchup, then called out unbeaten Floyd Mayweather for a world title showdown.

Khan improved to 31-3 with his fifth victory in a row, which came by judgesâ scores of 117-111, 117-111 and 115-113.

Algieri fell to 20-2 with his second defeat in a row, the other coming last November at Macau at the hands of Filipino star Manny Pacquiao â who lost to treble world champion Mayweather in boxingâs richest-ever megafight earlier this month.

âAmir Khan wants to fight Floyd Mayweather,â Khan screamed in the ring.

So letâs make it happen.â

Khan thought he might fight Mayweather in May last year but the US star instead decided to fight Argentinaâs Marcos Maidana.

Khan said support from the crowd helped him push to the finish and secure the decision.

âThe crowd really fired me up the last three rounds when Chris really came at me hard."
