Ramallah, occupied West Bank - Abdulfattah Arar, 47, has a huge responsibility to shoulder.

But when asked about the most difficult task associated with his new post, Arar had one answer: Israeli occupation.Â "It's probably psychological, but I never really thought of impediments to the game other than those imposed by the Israeli occupation," Arar told Al Jazeera.Â

Others were injured or detained, includingÂ Johar Halabiyeh,Â an Abu Dis player who was shot 11 times in his legs in January 2014.

Israeli authorities have imposedÂ restrictions onÂ the building of sports facilities, while Israeli forces have broken up games and evenÂ attackedÂ the Palestine Football Association (PFA) headquarters.

Last week, the PFA pushed for aÂ voteÂ to suspend the Israeli Football Association (IFA) membership in FIFA.Â

This is a fair deal,"Â PFA president, Jibreel Rajoub, told Al Jazeera.

However, the game suffered setbacks amid the 1948 displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes, the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, and two Intifadas.

It's not about suspending the Israel Football Association [IFA]; it's about our rights.

"We lost so many talents.

Forming the team with Palestinians from both parts of the geographic divide - the occupied West Bank and the besieged Gaza Strip - is a challenging task, Arar said.

In addition, players are systematically harassed, delayed, and detained at checkpoints and crossings, Arar said, echoing complaints from the PFA.

In Arar's hometown of Beit Ummar, northwest of Hebron, the local team has dropped from the top tier after seven of its players were arrested by Israeli forces for allegedly throwing stones.

In addition, the PFA has complained multiple times about delays in equipment shipments.

OPINION: Can FIFA's Blatter prevent Israel's suspension from international soccer?

In the football world, a suspension would mean that Israel, as a member of Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), would no longer compete in the Euro 2016 qualifiers and its clubs would be barred from the competition.

However, many believe the Palestinian FIFA motion is connected to wider efforts to expose what activists say are racist policies of the Israeli occupation.

Palestinians need to gain a three-quarter majority among FIFA's 209 members to pass the motion.

Over the past two years, FIFA president Sepp Blatter has been seeking a solution to Palestinian complaints, and has explicitly stated that he wants to avoid the looming vote.

Blatter recently met with Israeli and Palestinian officials in what he called a "mission of peace", telling Palestinians that the Israelis were willing to ease movement restrictionsÂ by giving Palestinian players special ID cards and creating an escort service between Gaza and the West Bank.

Blatter also said Israel had agreed to tax exemptionsÂ on equipment donated to the Palestinians.

However, the Israelis subsequently delayed the Palestinian National Football team atÂ Allenby Bridge as they were en route to Tunisia to prepare for upcoming matches.Â "If they want to avoid sanctions, the Israelis have to make concessions," Rajoub said.

IFA maintains that the Palestinian bid is an attempt to mix politics with sports.

"IFA is facing one of its most crucial situations since it was established in the year 1928, finding ourselves in the need to defend ourselves against a proposal which is totally political and has nothing to do with the objectives of FIFA and the spirit of football," IFA president Ofer Eini told UEFA president Michel Platini in a recent letter.

Palestinian football officials maintain it's a sports matter.

Besides movement and access restrictions, Palestinians cite two violations in their plight: The fact that the IFA allows five teams based in illegal West Bank settlements to compete in the Israeli league, thus encroaching on PFA territory and breaching international law - since settlements are considered illegal as per Geneva conventions.

Palestinians also accuse IFA of not dealing properly with racist behaviour- particularly that of their top-tier club Beitar Jerusalem.

"I don't think a vote will take place," he said, noting FIFA could avoid a vote by creating an independent committee that guarantees Palestinian players the right of movement.

According to Rajoub, the Israelis have been enjoying the privileges of the status quo.
