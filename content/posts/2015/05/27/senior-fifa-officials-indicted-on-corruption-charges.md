Swiss authorities have arrested six leading FIFA officials in Zurich on racketeering and bribery charges brought by the United States and announced they have opened a criminal case in connection with the allocation of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.

The arrested officials are among 14 people named in a 47-count indictment that was unsealed in federal court in New York City on Wednesday.

Among those charged in the indictment are FIFA Vice President Jeffrey Webb and Jack Warner - the current and former presidents of CONCACAF (the continental confederation under FIFA headquartered in the US).

FIFA President Sepp Blatter was not among the men arrested, FIFA spokesperson Walter de Gregorio confirmed.

"The General Secretary and President have not been arrested," de Gregorio said in a press conference.

"The 2018 and 2022 World Cups will be played in Russia and Qatar.

The US Department of Justice released a statement confirmed that the intensity of the investigation, confirming that the bribes in question mounted to "well over $150m".

"The defendants also include US and South American sports marketing executives who are alleged to have systematically paid and agreed to pay well over $150 million in bribes and kickbacks to obtain lucrative media and marketing rights to international soccer tournaments," the statement said.

âThe indictment alleges corruption that is rampant, systemic, and deep-rooted both abroad and here in the United States,â added US Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

World Cup investigation

Separate to the US indictment, the Swiss Office of the Attorney General (OAG) issued a statement saying it has "opened criminal proceedings against persons unknown on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and of money laundering in connection with the allocation of the 2018 and 2022 Football World Cups".

The OAG said it has seized data and documents from FIFA's IT systems on Wednesday as part of its investigation.

"It is suspected that irregularities occurred in the allocation of the FIFA World Cups of 2018 and 2022," the OAG statement said.

"The OAG and the Swiss Federal Criminal Police will be questioning 10 persons who took part in voting on the allocation of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups as members of the Executive Committee in 2010.

The US is expected to seek extradition of the officials who have been arrested.
