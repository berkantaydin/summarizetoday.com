Madagascar's parliament has votedÂ overwhelmingly to dismiss President Hery Rajaonarimampianina forÂ alleged constitutional violations and general incompetence.

The Indian Ocean island's constitutional court will now decide whether theÂ decision on Tuesday night to discharge Rajaonarimampianina can be enacted.

The US embassy had pledged support for the president and called onÂ parliament to put the stability of the country first, but the plea fell on deafÂ ears.

The motion was backed by 121 of the 125 lawmakers who voted, easilyÂ clearing the two-thirds majority required.

The parliamentary speaker, Jean Max Rakotomamonjy, said after the votesÂ were counted: "It is officially declared that everyone accepts that the requestÂ of dismissal can be submitted to the constitutional court".

'Voting irregularities'

The result was greeted with applause from many lawmakers, but some allegedÂ the vote had been ridden with irregularities.

One who refused to take part, Lydia Raharimalala, claimed there had onlyÂ been only around 70 lawmakers in parliament when they were called to vote.

"There's something wrong, there was cheating," she said, and promised toÂ take her claims to the constitutional court.

When Rajaonarimampianina took power in January 2014 - after the firstÂ democratic elections since 2006 - it was hoped Madagascar would finally emergeÂ from a deep political and economic crisis.

The island had been plunged into a state of crisis in 2009 when Rajaonarimampianina'sÂ predecessor Marc Ravalomanana was ousted in a coup.

Rajaonarimampianina, a trained accountant, promised a better life for theÂ inhabitants of one of the world's poorest countries.

But his opponents say he has failed to deliver on his economic promises andÂ accuse him of stalling on the establishment of a high court and theÂ implementation of promised reforms.
