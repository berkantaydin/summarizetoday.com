As with many things in the Iraq conflict different people can interpret the fall of Ramadi in different ways.

The overall strategy of fighting ISIL using Western-led air power and Iraqi-only land forces is another issue worthy of critical review.Â

Over a year on from the blitzkrieg advance of ISIL in Iraq it seems that whatever reorganisation, training and re-equipment that the army was given, it has failed to redress its previous humiliating defeat.

Despite the Iraqi prime minister's pleas to stand and fight now, it seems that soldiers are continuing to desert their positions.Â

Face-saving myths

A great many face-saving myths have been created about ISIL having superior weapons and training.

It was the US-led war for regime change in Iraq and its considerable investment in blood and treasure to establish a new form of government that is now proving to be an embarrassing failure.Â

These failures translate into successes for ISIL, which in turn feeds off one victory to produce another.

Yet regional and world powers seem to be treating ISIL as a low priority issue, even embarking on new political landscape gardening projects in Libya and Yemen.Â

The fact that US President Barack Obama held a summit with Middle East leaders to discuss a largely sectarian war in Yemen when no such meeting took place to confront ISIL is highly revealing.

In the face of this strangely fragmented and half-hearted opposition, it is no wonder that ISIL is able to continue to murder men, women and children...

Half-hearted opposition

They continue to destroy world heritage sites, some being the only record of particular ancient civilisations.

Yet the newfound self confidence and leadership of the Saudi regime has been relatively silent over this latest affront to its religion.Â

Lessons learned about the intrinsic strengths of revolutionary insurgencies in comparison with the strengths of conventional armies are not being applied.

Insurgencies are known to be able to adapt over time to conventional warfare tactics used against them.

The recent decision of the Iraqi government to deploy Shia militias to Ramadi underlines the poverty of strategy and of the concept of an Iraqi state.

Ponderous strategy

One of the reasons that ISIL continues to thrive is that the coalition has adopted a ponderous strategy, unable to capitalise swiftly on its advantages of air power and manoeuvres.

All the while, ISIL is learning to adapt to the coalition's strategy by, for example, avoiding concentrations of force to minimise targets for the coalition.

ISIL's continued successes in Ramadi and elsewhere should prompt regional powers and the US to reappraise their approach and strategy.

But first, if ISIL is to be beaten, then it must be seen and prioritised for what it is: The greatest current regional and global threat.
