The daughter of Cuban President Raul Castro has overseen a symbolic mass wedding for gay couples during the annual pride parade in the capital, Havana.

Same sex marriages are illegal in the mostly Catholic country.

The ceremony comes a day before Castro's visit to the Vatican for a meeting with Pope Francis.

Al Jazeera's Latin America Editor Lucia Newman reports from the Cuban capital.
