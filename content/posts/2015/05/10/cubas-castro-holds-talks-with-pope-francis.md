Cuban President Raul Castro has held talks with Pope Francis,Â who played a key role in the breakthrough between Washington and Havana aimed at restoring US-Cuban diplomatic ties.

Francis said on Sunday in his native Spanish, welcoming Castro in a studio near the Vatican public audience hall.

The meeting lasted nearly an hour, a generous amount of time by Vatican standards, especially considering that the Argentine-born Francis and Castro spoke in Spanish, without the need of interpreters that often use up time in other papal-VIP talks.

Castro had already publicly thanked Francis for his role in bringing Havana and Washington closer together after decades of US government policy of strict isolation of the Communist-ruled Caribbean island.

He apparently did so again during the closed-door meeting.

As he took his leave, Castro told journalists, "I thanked the pope for what he did."

"I ruined your Sunday," the pope quipped to journalists after the meeting.

He gave Castro a medal depicting St. Martin of Tours, known for caring for the destitute.

"With his mantle he covers the poor," Francis told Castro, saying more efforts on behalf of the poor are needed.

Francis will stop in Cuba for at least two days in September for a visit, part of a pilgrimage that will then take him to Washington, Philadelphia and New York.

Preparation for the papal's visit has already began in the Carribean Island.

That Vatican encounter helped pave the way for John Paul's 1998 pilgrimage to Cuba, the first visit by a pontiff to the island.

With the Vatican keen on protecting its Catholic followers in Cuba, Francis' predecessor, Benedict XVI, also visited the island.

Castro was also due to meet Matteo Renzi, Italian prime minister,Â later on Sunday before leaving Rome.
