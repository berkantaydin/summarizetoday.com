Eight police officers and 14 armed men have been killed in fighting in an ethnic Albanian area of northern Macedonia, according to the country's interior ministry.

At least another 37 people were wounded in the clashes between police and an armed group that started on Saturday in the town of Kumanovo.

Gordana Jankulovska, the interior minister,Â said more than 20 members of the group had surrendered, but that others refused to give up arms and were holed up in houses in Diva Naselba, a neighbourhood in western Kumanovo.

Jankulovska said the group, which had entered Macedonia from an unspecified neighbouring country, planned to "use the current political situation to perform attacks on state institutions".

Her spokesperson, Ivo Kotevski, later said some of the attackers killed wore uniforms with insignia of the disbanded ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, or UCK.

It is not known exactly how Saturday's fighting started.

Kotevski said on Sunday afternoon that the police operation was over and "one of the most dangerous terrorists groups in the Balkan [had] been neutralised".

Two days of mourning

The Macedonian government has declared two days of mourning for those killed in the operation.

About a fortnight ago, authorities said a group of about 40 people wearing UCK uniforms attacked a police watchtower in Gosince on Macedonia's northern border with Kosovo and briefly captured four Macedonian police officers.

Authorities described that incident as "very serious" and said Macedonia was the "target of a terrorist attack".

Kumanovo is an ethnically mixed town located about 40km northeast of the capital Skopje, near the border with Kosovo and Serbia.

The Kumanovo region saw hostilities between ethnic Albanian rebels and government forces during ethnic conflict in 2001.

This incident came a day after thousands of opposition supporters joined nationwide protests against alleged police brutality.
