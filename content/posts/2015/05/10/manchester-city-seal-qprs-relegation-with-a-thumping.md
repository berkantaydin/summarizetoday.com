Queens Park Rangers bowed out of the Premier League with a whimper after Manchester City's Sergio Aguero scored a hat-trick to lead his side to a crushing 6-0 victory over the London club.

QPR needed to win their remaining three fixtures to stand any chance of survival but defeat at the Etihad Stadium left them nine points adrift of 17th-placed Newcastle United with two games remaining.

Second-placed City confirmed their place in next season's Champions League.

QPR, who will join Burnley in the Championship, have collected just seven away points this season and were behind in the fourth minute when Aguero dinked over Robert Green before Aleksander Kolarov's free kick doubled the lead before half-time.

Aguero completed his hat-trick with goals in the 50th and 65th minutes before James Milner added a fifth and David Silva completed the rout three minutes from time.

QPR announced massive losses in March and could face heavy fines, points deductions and transfer embargoes under the Football League's Financial Fair Play rules.

Liverpool hold Chelsea

Meanwhile, Chelsea effectively ended Liverpool's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League after the newly crowned Premier League champions held them to a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.

Liverpool welcomed Chelsea with a guard of honour but the champions were in no mood to thank them and took the lead after five minutes when John Terry headed in from a corner.

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard capitalised on some slack Chelsea defending to equalise just before halftime but Brendan Rodgers's side failed to impose themselves in the second half.

With two games remaining fifth-placed Liverpool have 62 points from 36 matches, six behind Manchester United who occupy the final Champions League spot and have a better goal difference (+25 to +11).

Chelsea have 84 points from their 36 games, 11 more than second-placed Manchester City.

Results:

Man CityÂ 6-0Â QPR

ChelseaÂ 1-1Â Liverpool
