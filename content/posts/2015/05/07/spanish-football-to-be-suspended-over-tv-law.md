The Spanish football federation (RFEF) has decided to indefinitely suspend all domestic competition from May 16 over a spat with the government on issues including a new law on collective bargaining for television rights.

The law was approved in cabinet last week with the backing of the professional soccer league (LFP) and aims to create a more level playing field for clubs in Spain's top two divisions by sharing out TV cash more equitably.

However, both the RFEF, and its influential president Angel Maria Villar, and the players' union (AFE) have come out against the new rules and the two organisations have backed halting competition right across Spanish football.

The final two matchdays in La Liga would both be affected as well as the King's Cup final between Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao at the end of the month unless agreement can be reached to avert the action.

A total of 17 regional federations would be affected by the suspension, including more than 600,000 players and 30,000 matches, the RFEF said.

"At the same time, and yet again, we reiterate the offer of dialogue to the Spanish government," the federation added.

The current system favours big teams such as Real Madrid, the world's wealthiest club by income, and rivals Barcelona.

Poorer teams, especially those with big outstanding tax bills to pay, have called for rights to be pooled to help them make ends meet.
