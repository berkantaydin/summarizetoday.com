Nigerian military says it has rescued 25Â more children and women from Boko Haram as part of its ongoing campaign to attack andÂ destroy the armed group's camps in the northeast.

Army spokesman Colonel Sani Usman said many Boko Haram fighters were killed in a gun battle on Wednesday morning.

About 700 children and women have been rescued in the past week as soldiersÂ supported by air raids have deployed on foot into the Sambisa Forest, theÂ last stronghold of Nigeria's home-grown armed group.

Last week the army said they rescued 293 girls and women from the forest.

Some 219 remain missing.

According to human rights group Amnesty International, more that 5,500 civilians have been killed and more than 1.5 million people, including 800,000 children, have fled their homes due to the violence in the country's northeast.

Boko Haram, designated by the US as a "terrorist" organisation,Â has been fighting since 2009 to establish sharia law in all 36 states of Nigeria, which is roughly equally divided between a mainly Christian south and a largely Muslim north.
