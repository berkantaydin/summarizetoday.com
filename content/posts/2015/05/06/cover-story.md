Class dynamics are changing in Turkey.

When Turkey was founded in 1923 it was on firm secular principles.Â Turkish women were restricted in wearing the headscarf - known as the hijab outside Turkey - in all public sector jobs and universities for most of the 20th century.

We can't dress short and slim fit.

Hulya Aslan, editor of Ala magazine

During the current AKP party government, a young, confident, female, Muslim middle class has emerged, that is less worried about being socially accepted and more comfortable sharing public spaces with secularists.

Hulya Aslan is the editor of Ala, a monthly fashion magazine in Istanbul that serves a growing Turkish market of Muslim women who think that fashion and Islam are compatible - "conservative" women who want to wear the hijab but also want to dress fashionably, with colour and style.

But now that clothes designers have started to cater much more to Muslim women who want to dress modestly, it can mean colours, glossy fashion magazines and high street hijabi fashion stores.

"In the 90's, covering meant pardessus and a black burqa.

Busra Bulut, a student and journalist who writes for the conservative Turkish news magazine Haksoz strongly opposes it.

Or to exist?

This film follows Hulya Aslan at Ala and looks at hijabi fashion, social change in Turkey and the ongoing debate about a Muslim woman's right to choose how she dresses.
