More than 400 Mozambicans have been deported from South Africa, after authorities launched a nationwide operation targeting illegal immigrants in the country, officials said.Oldemiro Baloi,Â Mozambique's foreign and cooperation minister, said his government was surprised by the deportations.

Some of the returned Mozambicans said on Saturday that they were arrested and taken to a detention centre when they were found in South Africa without proper documents.Â In mid-May, authorities launched a joint operation between the police, Ministry of Home Affairs and the army, targeting undocumented foreign nationals across the country.

On Saturday, Zimbabwean activist Elinor Sisulu described the operation as a kind of "ethnic cleansing".

There he met dozens of other immigrants from other southern African countries, like Lesotho, Zimbabwe, and Malawi.

He lived in South Africa for two years, selling mobile phone SIM cards, he said.

Another Mozambican, Maria da Gloria Mathe, said she and her husband lived in the city of Rustenburg, in the South African platinum mining area, for four years, where they sold clothes.

"We collected what we could in a hurry, because the police were standing at the door of our shop," said Mathe.

While South African officials condemned the violence, they have also sought to address complaints that immigrants living in the country illegally are taking employment opportunities from South Africans.
