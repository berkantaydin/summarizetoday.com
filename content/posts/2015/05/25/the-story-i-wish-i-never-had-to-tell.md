I woke up frightened.

The quake

Part of me always knew I'd have to tell the story of the big quake - and I always hoped that it would never come to that.

They could not run in a straight line.

The mind works in strange ways.

As we drove back everything felt like a movie in slow motion.

Then another shock.

Dragging the children, we rushed back home - running through alleys.

The noise

Even among people I cared for, much went wrong.

Many of my favourite temples had turned to piles of rubble.

The very next day, I saw some friends drive with relief materials to badly hit areas.

Motion of any sort made my heart leap.

A week after leaving home, I get startled, every time a truck rumbles past.
