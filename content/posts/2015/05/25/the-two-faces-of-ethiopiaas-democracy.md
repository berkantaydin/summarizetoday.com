The opposition accuses the government of using authoritarian tactics to secure victory for the ruling party.

The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front has been in power for almost 25 years, during which there's been significant economic growth.

Human rights groups have regularly accused Ethiopia of clamping down on opposition supporters and journalists, and of using anti-terrorism laws to silence dissent and jail critics.
