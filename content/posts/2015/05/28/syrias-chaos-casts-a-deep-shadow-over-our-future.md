Its investment creates jobs and prosperity in every continent.

Improving transport links will see it continue to grow fast.

It is expected to see rail traffic increase from three million to 20 million tonnes by 2020.

And all of us must play our part in turn in finding solutions.

Collective hopes

More than 200,000 Syrians have perished, and over six million people are displaced within its borders with almost four million more taking refuge in neighbouring countries.

As well as the terrible impact on human lives and the tragic loss of talent and potential, the danger is that the despair will provide an additional recruiting cause for violent extremism.

Citizens of many different faiths and backgrounds live in peace and tolerance within our country.

After four years of fighting and the immense suffering it has caused, it is clearer than ever that only a political solution will prevent further bloodshed and destruction.

While violent fanaticism had not taken hold in Kazakhstan, it is a growing threat within our region.

Common ground

It is why, at the request of a number of Syrian opposition groups, we hosted talks this week to facilitate finding ways to tackle the country's humanitarian crisis and create the common ground to end the conflict.

No matter what difficulties there are to overcome, the Geneva process remains the best hope of a lasting and peaceful solution.

This, of course, requires improved cooperation on security and intelligence and the development of global anti-terror measures such as the recent UN Security Council Resolution on Foreign Terrorist Fighters which Kazakhstan co-sponsored.

We must strengthen efforts to stop money laundering and the financing of terrorism and to prevent weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorist groups.Â

Through KazAID, our development aid agency that is being established, we are determined to help promote stability and opportunity outside our borders.

Exploiting divisions

We are increasing our support for Afghanistan whose citizens have suffered badly from extremism.

We are proud to host the triennial Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions, whose fifth meeting takes place in Astana in June 2015.

We must also work together to tackle political challenges such as the continuing failure of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process which is a major source of tension.

But look beyond the immediate security and political challenges and it is a region rich in resources, talent, leadership and potential.
