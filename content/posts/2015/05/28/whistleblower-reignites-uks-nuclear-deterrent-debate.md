Glasgow, United Kingdom - To many, the common sight of one of Britain's nuclear submarines cutting through the waters of the River Clyde in Scotland is a symbol of national prestige, power, and defence.

The UK's nuclear deterrent known as Trident has been based at HM Naval Base Clyde on Scotland's west coast since the 1960s.

But earlier this month, the weapons system - today made up of four Vanguard-class submarines, which carry Trident missiles - was rocked by revelations from a naval nuclear weapons technician turned whistleblower, William McNeilly.

The Northern Irishman, who eventually surrendered himself to naval police and is currently under investigation, went on the run after detailing 30 alleged safety and security flaws on Trident submarines in an 18-page dossier.

These included a failure to check ID cards, fire risks from rubbish, the flouting of safety procedures, and a cover-up of a collision with a French nuclear submarine.

Blaming the messenger

"His revelations are very significant," Rob Edwards, environment editor of the Scottish Sunday Herald newspaper that initially broke the McNeilly story, told Al Jazeera.

The Royal Navy has called McNeilly's revelations "subjective and unsubstantiated", but public support for the submariner - who says he was on patrol with one of the vessels, HMS Victorious, earlier this year - has grown.

Some 7,000 people have signed an online petition calling for McNeillyÂ to be pardoned, and a group of Members of the Scottish ParliamentÂ backed a motion praising his "courageous actions".

Others have also thrown their support behind McNeilly.

"There's two unusual aspects to this," said the anti-nuclear campaigner.

"One is the length of detail - that it's a very long report detailing lots of things - and the second is that he's put his name out there for people to recognise him," Ainslie said.

"The content is more detailed that what we might get on other occasions - and it's from the perspective of being a relatively new junior member of the crew, but seeing all these things round about him and hearing accounts of previous incidents."

View from the deck

Yet, some observers have advised against reading too much into the failings alleged by McNeilly, who called Britain's Trident programme "a disaster waiting to happen".

John Large, an independent nuclear submarine analyst based in London, told Al Jazeera: "The Trident nuclear weapon systems and its delivery platform [were] genially tolerant of and resilient against the misdemeanours that McNeilly describes."

"That suggests a much more serious problem of human resources that are maybe being pushed to keep the submarines at sea," said Large.

A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defence told Al Jazeera an investigation was under way regarding the allegations in the dossier.

"We take security extremely seriously in both our personnel and submarine operations," she said.

Politics of deterranceÂ

While highlighting perceived faults with the UK's nuclear deterrent, McNeilly's revelations have also reignited the ongoing conflict between Britain's marked pro and anti-nuclear groups.

Both the ruling Conservatives and the Labour opposition at Westminster support the UK's nuclear deterrent - but anti-nuclear voices from within Britain's mother parliament were bolstered by the stunning electoral success of the Scottish National Party (SNP), which took 56 out of 59 Scottish constituencies in the UK general election on May 7.

There is a powerful nation to the east of us that will not be deterred by conventional means - but might be by nuclear means.

Mendoza told Al Jazeera the recent actions of Vladimir Putin's Russia in Eastern Europe made possessing nuclear weapons fundamental to the UK's long-term security plans.

We don't know if Iran develops nuclear weapons with a delivery system that might [threaten] Europe," MendozaÂ said.

"Everyone knows that there is an ancient antipathy between the Iranians and the British."

Global attention As speculation continues to surround the fate of McNeilly - and whether he will be charged under the Official Secrets Act - Edwards said the submariner's disclosures have given Britain's anti-nuclear campaigners extra impetus.

Indeed, in light of McNeilly's leaks, a bullish SNP has already looked to press the UK government on Trident safety by scheduling a House of Commons debate on the issue.

"The very fact that McNeilly did this means there is something wrong with the system," said Large.

[McNeilly's revelations] may be an indication of discontent - which I think it was," he said.
