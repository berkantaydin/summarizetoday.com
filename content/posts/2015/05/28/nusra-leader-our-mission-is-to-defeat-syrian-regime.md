The leader of the Nusra Front, one of Syria's most powerful rebel groups, has said that his group's main mission is to dislodge the regime of President Bashar al-Assad and that it has no agenda to target the WestÂ unless provoked.

"We are only here to accomplish one mission, to fight the regime and its agents on the ground, including Hezbollah and others," Abu Mohammed al-Golani said in an exclusive interview aired on Al Jazeera on Wednesday.

"Nusra Front doesnât have any plans or directives to target the West.

But his statements did include a warning against the US over its attacks on the armed group, which has been blacklisted a "terrorist organisation" by the US.

"Our options are open when it comes to targeting the Americans if they will continue their attacks against us in Syria.

'Khorasan fabricated'

Golani not only accused Western nations of backing the government of President Assad against the rebels, but of also fabricating the "Khorasan" group - which Washington says is a covert faction in Syria that aspires to attack the US.

"The West is targeting Nusra because they know we are the real threat to the Assad regime.

"There is nothing called Khorasan group.The Americans came up with it to deceive the public.

He also noted that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant group (ISIL), which has been accused of rampant atrocities and controls large parts of the country, was a main threat to the Nusra Front.

"Assad forces are fighting us on one end, Hezbollah on another and ISIL on a third front.

Alawites will not be targeted

When questioned whether the Nusra Front planned to establish Islamic state in Syria, Golani said that after the whole war is over, all factions and groups in the country will be consulted before consideringÂ "establishing an Islamic state".

Golani also said that his group will not target the country's Alawite minorityÂ despite their support for Bashar al-Assad's government.

"The battle does not end in Qardaha, the Alawite village and the birthplace of the Assad clan," he said.

"Our war is not a matter of revenge against the Alawites despite the fact that in Islam, they are considered to be heretics.
