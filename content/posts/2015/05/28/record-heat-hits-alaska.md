Long-held temperature records have been broken and the winter roads that are made entirely of ice, are melting earlier than usual.

On Saturday, Alaska, the 49th state of the US,Â was warmer than Arizona.

Whilst Fairbanks, Alaska reached 30C on Saturday, Phoenix, Arizona managed a mere 28C.

Such a major movement of warm water has worldwide weather effects - drought, flood, heatwave and chill.

Texas was enduring repeated heavy rain and a tornado of very rare strength, so far south, formed on the Texas/Mexico border.

Although Alaska has cooled a little and Texas is having a brief respite from incessant rain, the weather pattern has not changed.
