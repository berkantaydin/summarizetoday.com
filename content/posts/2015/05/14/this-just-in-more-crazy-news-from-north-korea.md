So, more crazy news from North Korea: according to the briefings by the National Intelligence Service, Minister of Defense Hyon Yong-chol had been executed for disrespect and insubordination.

However, many a North Korean watcher met the report with a skeptical smile.

On one hand, it is quite possible that another top North Korean military commander has just lost his job and, perhaps, his life, too.

Kim Jong-Un treats the upper crust of the country's political elite with remarkable harshness, and there is no need to have access to the top secret papers in order to see that a major purge is going on.

Within the last three years, top military commanders are replaced with remarkable speed, with the average term length for a minister of defense being less than six months.

Stalin-style political culture

It is also known that in December 2013 Kim Jong-Un ordered the arrest and execution of Chang Song-taek, a man who once was his second-in-command, and also happened to be his aunt's husband.

Some other top commanders and officials disappeared recently, and their faces and names were erased from re-published books and archival photos - a sure sign of purge in North Korea's Stalin-style political culture.

But the details, including the rather exotic method of execution, make one somewhat skeptical - especially if one keeps in mind some recent media reports about North Korea.

Do you remember the Hyon Song-wol affair?

But the details, including the rather exotic method of execution, make one somewhat skeptical...

The story was too good to be missed: a crazy dictator kills his lover who turned porno actress.

There is a problem, though: the charming Hyon Song-wol, proudly spotting the uniform of a North Korean army colonel (she signs for a military band and hence technically is a commissioned officer) appeared on TV in 2014, many months after her supposed public execution, and has been quite prominent ever since.

The "executed" diplomat is certainly alive since he is North Korea's current foreign minister.

Fed to the dogs?

Soon after the execution of Chang Song-taek, the media began to report that the old man was fed to the dogs alive.

The Hong Kong journalists did not mention that the blog specialised in producing fake satirical "news", Onion-style.

Why is North Korea treated in such a manner?

The government produces tonnes of comically inept propaganda (visit any North Korean official website to enjoy the style), and it is very repressive.

Second, utmost secrecy plays a role.

In this environment, a number of people are willing to produce fake news, which are likely to be believed and cannot be verified.

If the news item is catchy and sensationalist enough, it is likely to go viral, and even if subsequent events show that this particular "news" was nonsense, it is still often remembered as fact.

Was he really vaporised by anti-aircraft gunfire?
