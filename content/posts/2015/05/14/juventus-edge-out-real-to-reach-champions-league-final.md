Juventus shattered Real Madrid's dream of a record-extending 11th European crown when Alvaro Morata scored against his former club to secure a 1-1 Champions League draw with the holders and send Juve into the final 3-2 on aggregate.

Cristiano Ronaldo netted a 23rd-minute penalty at the Bernabeu to give Real the upper hand before Morata silenced the home fans when he rifled a shot into the roof of the net off goal-keeper Iker Casillas 12 minutes into the second half.

Morata, a Real academy graduate, also scored in the Italian champions' 2-1 win in the first-leg in Turin and Juve will bid for their third triumph in Europe's elite club competition when they face Barcelona in Berlin on June 6.

Real pushed desperately for the goal that would have taken the game to extra-time but squandered a host of chances and Juve remained on course for a treble of European and domestic league and Cup titles.

Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema all wasted chances on a warm night in the Spanish capital with Real dominating as expected and the baying home fans urging on their heroes.

Ronaldo, who is level with Barca forward Lionel Messi at the top of the 2014-15 scoring charts, became the first player to score at least 10 goals in four different Champions League campaigns.

The Portugal captain jointly holds the all-time goals record for the competition of 77 with Argentine Messi.
