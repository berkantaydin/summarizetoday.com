And then got crushed by reality.

And now, piling misery upon despair, the UK media is filled with politicians and pundits claiming that the Labour party, supposed representative of working people, lost the vote as a result of being too left of centre.

Yes, this is the analysis applied to an austerity-supporting, welfare-recipient-bashing, tighter-immigration-controls-espousing party (you saw the awful mugs, right?

Britain, the world's sixth largest economy, has for the past five years been run by a Conservative-led coalition that presided over the biggest drop in living standards since the Victorian age, with the poorest paying the highest price for austerity.

Avoidable hardship

Leading economists, from Paul KrugmanÂ Â to Joseph Stiglitz and even the IMF, have all argued that the government's austerity programme has made things worseÂ - paralysing economic recovery while deepening unnecessary and avoidable hardship (29 percent of children are in poverty; over a million people rely on food banks - again, this is one of the world's richest countries).

Now, the Conservatives, in power as an outright majority, have plans for even more welfare cuts of 13 billion pounds ($20.5bn) - which would further punish people for being disabled, or pregnant, or caregivers, or young, or in low-paid work, or out of work, or just born into families without the privilege or wealth that in reality separates the strivers from the so-called skivers.

Are we stuck with austerity forever or until we are all characters in Oliver Twist (whichever comes sooner), or can anything be learned from more successful progressives across Europe?

Labour's own goal basically gifted the Conservatives with the tagline of being the party to trust over the economy - in other words, Labour didn't just fail to form a frontier; it helped the Conservatives to fashion theirs.

Which leads us nicely to the first piece of advice.

Political frontier

says Marina Prentoulis, senior lecturer in media and politics at the University of East Anglia.

Prentoulis notes that, for Syriza (she is a UK spokesperson), the anti-austerity frontier went past traditional notions of "left" and "right" - not all Syriza voters were from the left - and so appealed across a spectrum of social groups in Greece.

Of course, there were warnings ahead of the UK elections about the traditional party of the left failing to take an anti-austerity position.

Gregory Philo, professor of communications and social change at the University of Glasgow, says he met Labour's media strategists five years ago and told them: "Whatever you do, you must not allow the lie of Labour's incompetence to take hold - if you do, you are sunk."

But it's probably best not to dwell on that one; let's move on to the next tip from the anti-austerity movement's guide to success: Grow the grassroots.

The open, "grassroots democracy" of this party harnessed growing street-level protests, creating neighbourhood assemblies with the power to propose and vote on policies.

Accountable politics

That obviously matters in and of itself: engaging and inspiring populations that currently feel ignored, hopeless and disempowered; making politics more relevant, accountable and representative.

Paul Mason, economics editor for Britain's Channel 4 news, notes in a recent blog, that the just-resigned Labour leader Ed Miliband's "inner team had almost no outriders in the press, no co-thinkers in academia; they had support among artists and film directors, but always half-hearted".Â

Without a support base behind you, there is little capacity to bat away attacks, make the case, spread the word, or build momentum.

That base can also help refute claims made by a hostile press - in a British print media landscape dominated by Conservative-supporting papers.

That's done by pointing out why those "messengers" - media proprietors - might have vested interests in being pro-Conservative.

"The SNP took them [the British press] head on and won," says Philo.

So, that's an initial and manifestly incomplete list; what would you add to this toolkit for anti-austerity movements?
