Athletes found guilty of doping offences deserve a second chance and should not be banned for life, according to former world 100m champion Kim Collins.

The US menâs 4x100 relay team, on Wednesday, was ordered to return its London 2012 silver medal because Tyson Gay, who was part of the medal-winning quartet, was suspended for a doping offence.

The team included Justin Gatlin, an Olympic gold medalist who served a four-year ban in 2006 for doping.Â

Usain Bolt, the 100m and 200m world record holder, called for Gay to be given a life ban from the sport.

Collins, however, believes that offenders should be allowed back in the sport after serving the suspension.

âEverybody deserves a second chance, not just in sports but in life,â Collins told Al Jazeera on the eve of the Diamond League in Doha.

We shouldnât be harsh to say that weâre going to do away with them for life.â

Time of âcrisisâ

The head of world athletics had admitted earlier this year that the sport faced "a crisis" over allegations of doping by Russian athletes.

Kenyaâs Boston and Chicago marathon winner Rita Jeptoo was handed a two-year ban as the national federation faced a difficult period due to numerous failed drug tests.

Collins, however, opted to look at the positive side and lauded the work of World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to catch the offenders.

Youâll always find people cheating and thatâs nothing new.

âIf you go into other sports and test as thoroughly as athletics, youâll find a lot more thatâs happening there.â

Rio 2016 hopes

On a personal level, Collins, who is 39, is hopeful of winning that elusive Olympics medal as he remains optimistic about taking part in Rio 2016.

The Saint Kitts and Nevis sprinter was sent home from London 2012 with missing training sessions given as the official reason.

âMy one goal before I retire is to run faster.

I had a great indoor season and Iâm hopeful.

Collins will be part of the 100m starting line-up in Doha with Gatlin, Jamaicaâs Nesta Carter and Qatarâs Femi Ogunode among others.
