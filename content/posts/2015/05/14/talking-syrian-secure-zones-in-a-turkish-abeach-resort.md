It was Rudyard Kipling that said East is East and West Is West and never the twain âshall meet.

To the east lies Syria and Iraq.

It was that thinking that dominated Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu's opening remarks at the NATO Foreign Ministers meeting in Antalya, Turkey.

Jan Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary General âechoed his remarks and said that more needed to be done in combating the threat from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

The reasons are clear.

NATO have fulfilled thier constitutional requirements by deploying the Patriot Missile defence system to it's border with Syria.

One idea it is thinking about is implementing secure zones in Syria that would allow for refugees to return, for international monitoring organisations and humanitarian aid stations to be established.

The idea was first floated by Turkey in 2012 and resurfaces on occasion at international summit.

We also know that they have discussed it with the US and with Saudi Arabia," he said.

So if all the member states are involved in the coalition against ISILâ in some way, then why have not the secure zones been established?

The answer lies in complex number of factors.

For Turkey it has always been Assad, the Americans insist it is ISIL.

For Turkey religion and culture also plays a part.

Antalya is close to the Syrian border but its provincial authority has discouraged them from coming.

"Because you do not see the refugees on the streets here and in other major urban centres it is not an issue for the people, but military action will be," continues Oguzlu.

There are also electoral considerations with an election just a few weeks away.
