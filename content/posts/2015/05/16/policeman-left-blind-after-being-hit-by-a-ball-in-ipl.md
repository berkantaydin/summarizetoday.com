A policeman has been left blind in one eye after being struck by six hit by South African David Miller in an Indian Premier League (IPL) match, local media reported.

Aloke Aich, 53, was struck in the right eye in the game between Kolkata and Punjab at Eden Gardens on May 9.

A freak accident!

Aich's son said Kolkata Police were paying the medical expenses but feared the accident might cost his father, the sole earning member in the family, his job as well.

With his right eye gone, I don't think he would be able to sit behind the wheel again," he told the Indian Express newspaper.

How will we survive if he loses his job?
