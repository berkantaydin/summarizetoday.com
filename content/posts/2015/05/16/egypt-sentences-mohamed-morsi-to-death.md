An Egypt court has sentenced former President Mohamed Morsi to death for a mass prison break in 2011, prompting immediate condemnationsÂ from Amnesty International and the Turkish President.

The court will pronounce its final decision on June 2.

International condemnation

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan criticised Egypt over the decision and accused the West of hypocrisy, according to the state-run Anatolian news agency said.

"While the West is abolishing the death penalty, they are just watching the continuation of death sentences in Egypt.

Human rights group Amnesty International said the trial was a "charade" and based on "void procedures".

"Condemning Mohamed Morsi to death after more grossly unfair trials shows a complete disregard for human rights...he was held for months incommunicado without judicial oversight and that he didnât have a lawyer to represent him," the organisation said in a statement.

The judiciary is doing its part to cement a new political reality in Egypt, one that seeks to silence all dissent and restore the full strength of the authoritarian system that was in place for decades

Abdullah al-Arian, Georgetown University

Abdullah al-Arian, assistant professor of History at Georgetown University, School of Foreign Service in Qatar, told Al Jazeera theÂ death sentences handed down on Saturday would "come as no surprise to anyone who has been following developments in Egypt over the past two years".

Judges killed

Saturday's sentence came as an attack in the Sinai peninsula left three judges dead and another three wounded.

The group were travelling by car from Ismailiya to El Arish when they were shot at by unidentified gunmen.

Since Morsi's removal by now President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a series of attacks have targeted security forces in Sinai, but Saturday's attack was the first against members of the judiciary.

They had been charged with colluding with foreign powers, the Palestinian groupÂ Hamas and Iran to destabilise Egypt.

The court acquitted the former president of murder charges that could have seen him face the death penalty.Â
