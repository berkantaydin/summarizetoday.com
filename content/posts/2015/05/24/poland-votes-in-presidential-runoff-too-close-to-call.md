Poles have started voting in the final round of a cliffhanger presidential election with incumbent Bronislaw Komorowski trying to fend off the challenge of conservative newcomer Andrzej Duda.

After nearly eight years in power, the centrist Civic Platform (PO) - associated with Komorowski - is running neck and neck in the polls with Duda's right-wing opposition Law and Justice Party (PiS).

Komorowski, a 62-year-old communist-era dissident, has been popular and was easily expected to win re-election on May 10 but was stunned by his razor-thin defeat in the first round to his challenger.

Neither candidate however received the 50 percent of votes needed to win the election outright.

Duda, a 43-year-old lawyer and and member of the European Parliament with the Law and Justice party, scored a victory by just one percent by winning over disillusioned voters with promises of generous social spending, an earlier retirement age and lower taxes.

The first round had a large protest vote for a rock star.

"The victory of one or the other will be a narrow one and is impossible to predict on the basis of polls," Stanislaw Mocek, a political scientist at the Polish Academy of Sciences, told the AFP news agency.

Exit polls will be published when polling stations close at 9pm local time (19:00 GMT), but final results are not expected until Monday at the earliest.
