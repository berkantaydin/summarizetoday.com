These events are part of the growing strength in Iraq and the greater Middle East of paramilitary forces supplementing, even supplanting the regular military during intra-state conflicts.Â

The new frontline between Iraq and ISIL is Habbaniya military base outside of Ramadi.

So why did the city fall if the Iraqi state had warning of an impending attack?

Failure to invest in defenceÂ

The Iraqi government simply failed to invest in the defence of the city, either with larger numbers of the conventional military forces or the more battle-hardened militias.

Retaking Tikrit on the other hand was both symbolic and tactical, as it avenged ISIL's massacre of mostly Shia army forces in nearby Camp Speicher, and it put the Iraqi forces closer geographically to retaking Mosul.

Ali al-Hatim, a sheikh in the large Arab Sunni Dulaymi tribe, described the possible deployment of the Shia militias there as akin to an "Iranian occupation".

If he had deployed the Shia militias beforehand, it would have served as fodder for Abbadi's critics of his sectarian bias.

Such comments now provide Abbadi with the political cover he needs to deploy the Shia militias.

If Arab Sunni tribal leaders are themselves requesting the militias' support, Abbadi can deflect both US and local criticism of overreliance on these forces.

Sunni tribal fighters

Second, the fall of Ramadi also allows Abbadi to incorporate Arab Sunni tribal fighters into the Shia militias, rather than giving them their own autonomous force.

This cooperation provides deflection from critics that the militias are sectarian, and removes the onus on Abbadi to reconstitute the Reawakening (Sahwa) Forces.

If Abbadi were to reconstitute the Reawakening Forces, it would have given Iraq three separate paramilitary forces; the Kurdish Peshmerga (the military of the Kurdistan Regional Government), the Shia militias, which are themselves divided into numerous factions, and a third autonomous Arab Sunni force.

While Abbadi has made efforts to arm the Arab Sunni tribes in Anbar, the central government can now have more control of the Arab Sunni tribal fighters combating ISIL, who will have to embed with the Shia Popular Mobilisation Forces to gain access to the militias' arsenal to combat a heavily armed ISIL.

The dynamics playing out in the fight for Ramadi are indicative of a transformation of the role between the military and the state in the Middle East.

Iraq has fallen into the in-between category of states that have developed hybrid military and paramilitary forces during an intra-state conflict.Â Examples would include Lebanon, where Hezbollah exists alongside the Lebanese military; Syria, where the conventional military and the paramilitary Shabiha (now the National Defence Forces) maintain the Assad regime; and Yemen, where Houthi militias and the regular army forces loyal to ousted President Ali Abdullah Saleh have gained control over most of northern Yemen.

Fighting capability

The conventional Iraqi Security Forces have demonstrated that they cannot combat ISIL without tandem operations with the Shia militias.

However, estimates indicate that there are a total of 60,000 to 120,000 fighters in these militias, and Arab Sunni volunteers are unlikely going to swell their numbers significantly.

These low numbers mean the militia forces cannot be garrisoned at a base for long periods to control the surrounding area.

Their strength comes from their political value, in that the Shia militias have demonstrated that the Iraqi state cannot hold against ISIL without them.

Before the rise of ISIL, some, not all, of the Shia militias enjoyed a parallel political presence in the institutions of the Iraqi state.
