Barcelona, Spain - In May 2011 with an economic crisis engulfing Spain, protesters set up encampments in plazas all across the country demanding, as they said, "real democracy now", in opposition to politicians "who don't represent us" and the "dictatorship of the markets".Â

Four years later, on an overcast evening, one of those activists Gala Pin stood on stage in Barcelona's central square and told a several thousand-strong crowdÂ that at the time of those encampments, "we could never have imagined we were at the beginning of a process to reclaim democracy".

Nor did she imagine, Pin said, that she and many of her fellow activists would be returning to Placa Catalunya for a rally as candidates of a political party that, after local elections on Sunday, could be running the city of Barcelona.Â

The party, Barcelona en ComÃº (Barcelona in Common), which was started less than a year ago, is a coalition of social activists who have never held political office.

It is an attempt, they say, to radically democratise local politics by making government institutions responsive and accountable to citizen participation.Â

The strategy from BarcelonaÂ is being reproduced across Spain.Â

She told the crowd in Placa Catalunya at the campaign's final rally that she would "lead by obeying your orders".Â

Lack of trust

This crisis of political legitimacy is exacerbated by the second highest unemployment rate in Europe, low wages, and anger against cuts to social welfare.

In many cases allied with anti-austerity party Podemos, and using crowdsourced electoral platforms, social activists are running for office under names such as Ahora Madrid (Madrid Now) and Zaragoza en Comun (Zaragoza in Common).Â

Javier Toret, the developer of Barcelona en ComÃº's online participation platforms, said he is influenced by theorists such as Michel Bauwens, who is working in the field of peer-to-peer technology to create new forms of democracy.

Bauwens told Al Jazeera given historical problems with monolithic political parties on the one hand, and problems with direct democratic assemblies on the other, "the most realistic option is to combine electoral democracy with new forms of deliberative and participative democracy".

Toret was particularly inspired by web tools from Reykjavik in Iceland, where users proposed and debated policies online, took budgetary decisions, and voted on neighbourhood issues.

Using a similar model, 1,000 people took part online in the creation of Barcelona en ComÃº's ethical code.

Online reform

Some ran consultations using physical maps of the city on which participants could mark the key issues affecting them.

This crowdsourced electoral platform for running the city of Barcelona includes stopping the privatisation of health services, tackling high utility bills, controlling mass tourism, creating a renewable energy operation, and improving municipal democracy, with a portion of the city budget allocation decided directly by citizens.Â

Mayoral candidate Ada Colau is a founder of the Mortgage Victims' Platform (or PAH), one of Spain's strongest social movements, created in the wake of the economic crisis to resist a wave of housing evictions.

In her former role as spokesperson for the PAH, Colau became a household name when she called the head of the Spanish Banking Association a criminal in a televised hearing in the national parliament.

Meanwhile, in the Spanish capital, the candidate for Ahora Madrid, Manuela Carmena, 71, a former judge with a record of defending human and labour rights, has come out of nowhere to pose a serious challenge to the Partido Popular's Esperanza Aguirre.Â

Recent opinion polls show Carmena taking second place to Aguirre with a margin of just two seats.Â

Town-hall politics, however, is not a low stakes game; Ahora Madrid's proposals for participatory budgeting and citizen decision-making could well reverse privatisation in the city outright.Â

Anti-austerity

If Colau and Carmena's mayoral campaigns are successful, their ally Podemos, whose strong showing in polls last year recently flagged, could see increased support in the run-up to Spain's national elections at the end of 2015.Â

Yet, even if they don't win Barcelona or Madrid, adherents of municipalismo look set to form the main opposition, inserting a large number of radicals committed to participatory politics into these cities' institutions.

But it seems likely their presence will make it hard for other politicians to resist calls for a more open, participatory democratic style.Â

And if they do win, the "citizen candidates" are looking to have an impact well beyond city borders.

"I want to make Barcelona a democratic reference for the world," Ada Colau said at the rally in Placa Catalunya.
