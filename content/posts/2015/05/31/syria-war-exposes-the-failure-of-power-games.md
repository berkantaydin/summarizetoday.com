ISIL has taken Palmyra and the fear that they may destroy an ancient site is reverberating across the world.

Over 200,000 deaths and millions displaced, and the world is more concerned over Palmyra (and the mediatic manipulations of ISIL) than the plight of Syrians.

The barrel bombs or the quieter suffering in the refugee camps, whether the elderly slowly dying or children with hobbled futures, are less visible, and of less concern.

The loss of Palmyra is indeed irreplaceable, but the loss of hundreds of thousands of individual lives seems less so.

Why should one be bothered about this particular human tragedy?

Political ambitions

Indeed, it is not only the fate of Palmyra and ISIL's evil acts that trump the lives of the Syrian people, it is also the political ambitions of all involved.

Iran's regional interests mean the defence of Hezbollah and Syria at all costs.

Syria is indeed the playground for unmitigated selfish calculation.

The patient will probably die while the doctors are busy in consultation.

There are however incipient signs, slim rays of light, that the bloody gridlock of Syria is forcing a reassessment, even among highly experienced diplomats.

Geopolitical ambitions

Ironically, despite the geopolitical ambitions, the Middle East is worse off today as a result of the Syrian disaster with all powers losing control.

Former UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi has written a human plea for countries to protect and shelter Syrian war refugees.

I have recently heard senior and experienced policymakers from the region indicate that the Syrian people must be put front and centre to override the gridlock of classical interest-driven diplomacy.

The US and Russia are trying to find common ground, including by engaging regional actors, but, as Marwan Bishara reports, even Ukraine and Iraq get tangled up in the deal-making.

New thinking patterns

The hope, however, is that the difficulties encountered by conventional geopolitics may create pressures strong enough to eke out new thinking patterns.

Common sense dictates that Syrians, like others, require the straightforward setting up of a government that meets their natural emotional and material needs.

The clear answer today is no.

Many Syrian actors wish to compel others to their ways.Â

Syrian people

This can be mitigated if geopolitical actors, instead of favouring one actor, strongly support principles in favour of the Syrian people, including the territorial integrity of Syria and a political space that excludes all oppression, and guarantees the rights of all individuals, groups, and sects.

Although Syria suffers today, it can be any other nation tomorrow.

It may also be time for many across the globe to stretch their imagination and see that each of the victims in Syria has a life as unique as Palmyra.

A more human politics would recognise and partake in a "universal law": We all share the same basic emotional and physical needs.
