This week the Chairman and CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, announced on social media that he is currently reading "The Muqaddimah" - a book written in 1377 by the Islamic historian Ibn Khaldun about the history of the world.

For different reasons, but still in a similar way, many were fascinated when the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence recently released what it found on Osama bin Laden's "bookshelf"Â during the May 2011 raid that killed the al-Qaeda leader.

While Mark Zuckerberg posted on his personal Facebook page why he is reading The Muqaddimah, we can only guess why bin Laden chose to read the books he possessed.

So what does bin Laden's book collection tell us about him?

The think-tank scene

So whoever was providing or recommending papers to bin Laden published by think-tanks knew what they were doing.

At least 26 papers in bin Laden's collection were produced by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point - one of the leading counterterrorism think-tanks in the world.

The prestigious British think-tank Chatham House also features on the list.

Coincidentally for me, one document in bin Laden's collection: "The Evolving Al-Qaeda Threat",Â was authored by James Phillips, my colleague at The Heritage Foundation and a veteran Middle East expert.

This probably reflects bin Laden's curiosity [or considering the banality of most think-tank papers, his boredom].

This probably reflects bin Laden's curiosity (or considering the banality of most think-tank papers, his boredom).

This was further made evident by the thousands of recently unclassified correspondence between bin Laden and his field operators.

Conspiracy, France, and video games

The selection of English language books found in the compound is curious - especially, some of the loopier conspiratorial books like "Secrets of the Federal Reserve" or "New Pearl Harbor: Disturbing Questions about the Bush Administration and 9/11".

Yeah right.

It is likely this was more pleasure reading for bin Laden than anything else.

We also learned from his book collection that bin Laden had a fascination with France.

After successful attacks in the UK and Spain, France would be a natural target.

Considering that bin Laden met his death at the hands of US Special Operations Forces, and that throughout his time al-Qaeda's leader sent dozens of young men on suicide missions, it is ironic that copies of a guide to the videogame "Delta Force Extreme 2" and a suicide prevention book were found in his collection.

Tip of the iceberg

Assuming he was stuck in his Abbottabad compound for years one must assume that his boredom, at times, was relieved by reading.

It is also important to note that the list of reading materials that were recently made public were only a small selection of what the US gathered during the 2011 raid, and only the tip of the iceberg from what bin Laden actually had in his compound.Â

I once heard a senior US official with intimate knowledge of the raid say that the only thing preventing the Navy SEALS from taking even more stuff from bin Laden's compound was space on the helicopters and the need to leave the scene in a hurry.

Only the Pakistanis know what was left behind.
