Ottawa - In the late summer, as villages began the preparation for winter, the trucks would tour the villages.

The man from the government would explain the children were being removed, taken away from their homes and their families and given a place at a residential school.

If anyone complained or protested, they were told they were blocking what was best for the child.

At five years old you believe everything.

Annie Johnston, residential school survivor

So the children left, with tears in their eyes and confusion at what they had done and where they were going.

Across Canada, for more than 100 years, children of the indigenous population, or First Nation as they are known here, were taken away as part of the policy of "aggressive assimilation", or as one survivor put it, "They tried to beat the Indian out of us."

The idea was simple.

Their traditions, their language and the heritage would be ignored.

I was six," said one survivor.

Canada's first prime minister, Sir John Macdonald, believed the system was the future: "When the school is on the reserve, the child lives with his parents who are savages; he is surrounded by savages.

Children were tortured.

In one school, there was even a crudely put together an electric chair where "unruly" boys were made to sit and a current was sent shocking through their body.

Thousands dead

One man choking back the tears said: "I used to look at the sky and know my parents were looking at the same stars.

Another said "the priest told us we were uncivilised.

The final school closed in 1996.

Record-keeping was poor and the guilty could hide their secrets.

Finally, the survivors as they called themselves realised they had been the victims of abuse.

They banded together and took the government to court and won.

For more than five years, the Commission travelled all over the country, gathering evidence and hearing testimony.

Survivors gathering

In a packed function room in a hotel in the Canadian capital, Ottawa, many of those who'd been abused gathered to hear the report.

Among them was Annie Johnston.

The abuse was constant, the humiliation unforgiving.

It was nothing less than the systematic and concerted attempt to extinguish the spirit of the aboriginal peoples.

Justice Murray Sinclair

"My brother was at the same school on the boys side.

At five years old you believe everything."

It's 50 years since Annie left the school but every day she remembers something; a moment, a smell or a sound and she returns.

âI didn't know how to be a mother, how could I?"

And so another generation felt the pain and the anger.

Justice Murray Sinclair - himself from the First Nations - chaired the commission.

The standing ovation lasted for minutes.

"It was nothing less than the systematic and concerted attempt to extinguish the spirit of the aboriginal peoples,", Sinclair continued.

"But as the survivors have shown us, they have survived."

'New chapter'

Beside me a woman rocked back and forth.

"Too long, too long.

The commission has made 94 recommendations.

"It's time to start a new chapter in Canada where everyone is treated equally," said Justice Sinclair.

It is merely a beginning.
