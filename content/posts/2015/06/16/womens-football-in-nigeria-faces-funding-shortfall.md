Nigeria's Super Falcons are currently in Canada for the Women's Football World Cup.

They'll play former champions, the United States, on Saturday.

The Super Falcons are one of only three African teams that qualified to play, but despite the national team's success the women's game in Nigeria struggles to get funding.

Al Jazeera's Yvonne Ndege reports.
