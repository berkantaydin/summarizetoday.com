In the United States, mosques have become common gathering sites for two disparate groups - Muslim worshippers, and anti-Muslim hatemongers.

An estimated 500 anti-Muslim protesters descended in front of the Islamic Community Center, some armed with guns, clad in army fatigues, lifting signs that read: "Stop Islam", and donning shirts reading "F**k Islam".

Behind a backdrop of the mosque's minaret and Muslim counterprotesters, the anti-Muslim rally promised to "take back America".

Seemingly everybody in front of the mosque carried a gun, except the Muslims.Â

White privilege and protests

While nativist, white factions - armed to the teeth and explicitly vowing violent action - are continuously extended the protections denied to non-white protesters.Â

The idea that free speech is protected equally across racial lines is a fiction.

The overwhelmingly white throng of 500 anti-Muslim protesters - who spewed racial and religious slurs, donned camouflage as if prepping for war, and brandished guns and other weaponry - embodied every element of a "violent mob", or an "imminent threat".

The whiteness brandished by the anti-Muslim protesters - within a state where racism and xenophobia infamously thrive - was the most potent part of their protest.

Whiteness, time and again, spurs immediate imagery of peace, patriotism and Americanness - regardless of how menacing and violent it actually is - which typically results with the state protecting it far more than it punishes it.

This factor, combined with the fact that the target of the hate speech were Muslims and Islam, augments the First Amendment rights of the anti-Muslim protesters.

Free speech v free exercise

The US Constitution's foremost law presumptively protects the speech of actors like the anti-Muslim protesters in Phoenix.

In the US, neither racism nor Islamophobia are per se illegal.

While carrying weapons, organised, and seemingly ready to pounce on Muslim American counterprotesters, the anti-Muslim action aimed to cultivate and spread armed Islamophobic actions throughout the state.

An emergent, armed anti-Muslim movement in Arizona will create a culture where Muslims in the state will fear worshipping in their mosques, donning headscarves and beards, and practising in their mosques.Â Protecting this speech, which rises from the very same nativist element that target "illegal immigrants" and black Arizonans, comes with the reciprocal cost of diminishing the religious rights of Muslims in the state.Â

Begging the question - whose rights should matter more: The rights of armed hatemongers that encourage and embolden violence towards Muslims in Arizona; or the free exercise rights of a vulnerable community, trapped within a state where xenophobia, racism, and now Islamophobia thrive?
