Closing arguments are to be made in the fifth hearing of the much-delayed retrial in Egypt ofÂ two Al Jazeera journalists, Baher Mohamed and Mohamed Fahmy.

The previous four sessions in the Cairo court were all adjourned.Â Where do things stand now?

How many of your journalists are in court?

What is the latest status with the case?

Were you reckless in reporting from Cairo when you knew the risks?

Was it negligent that your journalists did not have accreditation from the Egyptian authorities?

Mohammed Fahmy says he has declared war on Al Jazeera.

Fahmy accuses you of âepic negligenceâ before the arrests.

Did Al Jazeera's head of security advise against the deployment of any further teams to Egypt?

Did Al Jazeera receive any diplomatic warnings regarding its operations in Egypt?

Why did you not pay Fahmy's bail?

Why did you not pay for Fahmy's lawyer?

How could you have put up such a catastrophic legal defence in the first trial?

Why did you put AJE reports on Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr, when Fahmy asked you not to?

Why did you choose to seek compensation from the Egyptian government last year?

Why didn't you act on Mohammed Fahmy's warnings and his offer to help mediate between Al Jazeera and the Egyptian authorities in late 2013?

Were your journalists caught up in a battle between Egypt and Qatar?

How many days did Al Jazeera's journalists spend in jail?

Did you pay $1.5m to protesters, as alleged by your former lawyer?

How could Al Jazeera have expected anything other than this situation with its Muslim Brotherhood bias?

OK, but the Arabic channels are biased.

How has the #FreeAJStaff campaign been going?

Two - Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed.

Al Jazeera Arabic presenter Ahmed Mansour was part of a separate case.

We continue to defend their innocence from truly bizarre charges.

Baher and Mohamed are guilty of nothing except excellent journalism.

Al Jazeera's mission is to accurately cover events and shed light on people and issues in some of the most difficult environments in the world.

All news organisations take risks when deploying to hostile environments.

Journalists take risks to bring you the information you need.

Thatâs where the blame properly lies.

None of this justifies criminal proceedings and jail time.

We are focused on getting him and his colleagues out of this predicament.

Fahmy accuses you of "epic negligence" before the arrests.

Nobody takes safety more seriously than Al Jazeera.

No, never.

However, the Egyptian authorities have banned Al Jazeera from access to banking facilities.

We elected to cover those legal fees, even though we believed that a united defence would be a better choice.

We hired leading Egyptian Bar-accredited lawyers.

Our current lawyers secured a retrial in January.

But AJMM also used footage from a variety of sources, including international news agencies Â and citizen journalists.

There wass unlikely to be a good time to table this.

He was finally released months later after strenuous campaigning led to mounting international pressure.

The advice of Fahmy and many others in Al Jazeera was taken into consideration.

We have always done everything possible to maintain good relations with the Egyptian government.

It's a recent attempt to distract people from the main issue of press freedom.

Baher and Mohamed were released 12 days later on bail pending retrial.

Al Jazeera covered the costs for his hospital suite and treatment throughout those seven months.

Did you pay $1.5m to protesters as alleged by your former lawyer?

This is patently false.

Only those who want to see one side of the story told, would consider Al Jazeera's reporting biased.

This includes governments, secularists, activists and Islamists including the Muslim Brotherhood.

Our Arabic channels are the most-watched and most credible in the Arab world, with Al Jazeera Arabic having more viewers than all of its competitors combined.

They want to go back to the situation that existed before Al Jazeera - official narratives peddled to the public.

â¢ Global opinion is loud and clear - the Egyptian authorities should drop all charges against Al Jazeera's journalists Our web campaign has been viral, making billions of social media impressions with the hashtag #FreeAJStaff.

â¢ Governments have responded, and the detentions have been criticised by the United States, European Union and others.

If this stands unchallenged, this formula will be repeated elsewhere.
