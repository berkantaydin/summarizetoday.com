Barack Obama has admitted that the US has no complete strategy for training Iraqi forcesÂ to fight the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group.

The US president made the comments after meeting the Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abbadi on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Germany on Monday.

ISIL has continued to gain ground in both Iraq and Syria, despite months of US-led air strikes and the US training thousands of Iraqi troops.

Obama touted "significant progress" in areas where the US has trained Iraqis to fight but said forces without US assistance are often ill-equipped and suffer from poor morale.

ISIL fighters captured the key Anbar provincial capital of Ramadi last month, prompting Defence Secretary Ash Carter to lament that Iraqi troops lacked "the will to fight".

OPINION: A winning strategy for the anti-ISIL coalition

Obama said that the 3,000 US service personnel in Iraq sometimes find themselves with "more training capacity than we've got recruits".

"We want to get more Iraqi security forces trained, fresh, well-equipped and focused and Abbadi wants the same thing so we're reviewing a range of plans for how we might do that," Obama said.

"We don't have, yet, a complete strategy, because it requires commitments on the part of Iraqis as well about how recruitment takes place, how that training takes place."

Sunni support

The Iraqi military has been the beneficiary of billions in US assistance dating back to the war started during the administration of US President George W Bush in 2003.

Obama and Abbadi also met one-on-one shortly before the president departed for Washington.

The White House has long blamed Iraq's sectarian divisions for stoking the kind of instability that allowed the group to thrive.

They are also given individual military equipment.
