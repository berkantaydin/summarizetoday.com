We live in a do-it-yourself age.

Meet Local Motors, the company behind one of the world's first 3D-printed cars.

The body is printed.

Local Motors' CEO John "Jay" Rogers hopes, by 2017, buyers will be able to go online, customise their car and have it printed out in just 44 hours.

Henry Ford never had an internet.

Want three cup holders instead of two?

The sky's the limit when it comes to putting it together and that is one of the primary reasons why Rogers chose 3D printer technology to make his cars.Â

"3D-printing a car is about totally changing the way in which we think about the base construction of the vehicle, " Rogers, 42, an Iraq war veteran and former US Marine captain, told Al Jazeera.

"It allows you to move the speed of production forward very quickly because there are no tools.

Carbon fibre and plastic Local Motors' 3D prototype, called the "Strati", rolled out officially in September 2014 in Chicago at the International Manufacturing Technology Show.

It travels at roughly 40km per hour and looks a little like something Batman would drive.

The car is made of carbon fibre and plastic and to the touch feels just like metal.

He thinks his Strati could change the world.

One of their 3D printers is right next door at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, home of some of the US' greatest nuclear secrets but also where new innovations in energy and science are developed.

Rogers says his cars will be made at a fraction of the cost of the big automakers like Ford and General Motors and take less time to build.

Safety concerns

While most automobiles have 20,000-30,000 parts, the Strati has fewer than 50.

Rogers hopes he can sell the car for as low as $5,000 someday but they're still working out the price tag which could initially be somewhere between $18,000-$30,000.

Some analysts are sceptical.

"It appears to be something fun to drive in a closed environment."

Moreover, she adds, safety is high on many buyers' list and a car made of carbon fibre and plastic will be a tough sell.

The beauty of the 3D-printed technology is it's constantly changing, including the safety features.

The race is officially on.Â
