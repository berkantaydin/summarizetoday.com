Washington, DC - You would think being the president of the United States would mean you have a ton of choices.

You've got a big house with a bunch of cooks who serve at your pleasure.

I bring this up, because according to White House officials when it comes to fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the president has only two choices: Do what he's been doing or launch a full scale invasion of Iraq.

They say those that don't think the status quo is working are advocating for another war.

He says the US goal is not to get directly involved in foreign conflicts, but that they can be effective by training local forces.

In the case of Iraq, he says the Iraqi military, with the help of US training and coalition air strikes can defeat ISIL eventually.

The strategy was questioned when Mosul fell.

Stark choice

There was a new government in Baghdad when Ramadi fell.

Well they had been trained by the US once, but not twice more accurately.

I don't know many Americans that want to or are willing to let the country go back to war in Iraq.

The president could send in forward military air controllers.

Basically those are US personnel that go into a city, point a laser and show the pilots what to bomb.

That is also a dangerous mission and it would mean huge risks.

More action

The country would be outraged beyond words, and presidents can lose options if a public outcry reaches a fever pitch and demands more action.

That option would probably include at least some American troops fighting in combat.

That would likely mean more American casualties.Â The president does have options, but they are riskier for his country and the military he commands.

They want to put more focus on training and equipping the military.

The fact that he so publicly slapped his partners, the very people he needs if the strategy is going to work should show the level of frustration within the administration.

I can't help but wonder if at some point in this debate someone is going to bring up what became known as the "Colin Powell Pottery Barn rule".

He famously told President George W Bush, like the furniture store, "If you break it, you buy it.
