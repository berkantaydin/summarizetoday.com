Barcelona were crowned kings of Europe for the fifth time after beating Juventus 3-1 in the Champions League final at the Olympic Stadium, capping their magnificent season with a treble of titles.

Goals from Ivan Rakitic in the fourth minute, Luis Suarez in the 68th and Brazilian Neymar at the end of stoppage time sealed the Catalans' second treble, following their feat in 2009, after they also won the La Liga title and Spanish King's Cup.

It was a bitter evening for Juve, who became the first team in the history of the competition to lose six finals in total, having also now been defeated in their last four.

Barca overcame a nervous start when a sublime combination, in which all 10 outfield players touched the ball, eventually saw Neymar feed captain Andres Iniesta, who picked out Rakitic to score the fourth fastest goal in a European Cup final.

Juve goal-keeper Gianluigi Buffon, who won the World Cup in Berlin's Olympic stadium in 2006 with Italy, denied Barcelona a second goal in the 13th minute with a superb one-handed save to keep out a Dani Alves shot.

The 38-year-old stopper again came to the rescue three minutes after the restart and Juve then grabbed an equaliser against the run of play through former Real Madrid striker Alvaro Morata.

However, Juve's joy was short-lived as Lionel Messi had an effort that Buffon could only parry to Suarez who followed up with an almost identical goal to the Italians'.

Neymar then had a goal disallowed after his header bounced off his own outstretched hand to deceive the diving Buffon, much to the Brazil forward's frustration.

Juventus, the second oldest team in a European final with an average age of just over 30, fought bravely but ran out of steam as Neymar scored with the last kick in stoppage time.
