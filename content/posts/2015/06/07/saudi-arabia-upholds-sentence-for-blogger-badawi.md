Saudi Arabia's Supreme CourtÂ has upheld a 10-year prison sentence and 1,000 lashes for the jailed blogger Raif Badawi, according to the human rights group Amnesty International.

Badawi was arrested in 2012 in the city of Jeddah, and later sentenced to seven years in jail and 600 lashes for setting up the website "Free Saudi Liberals" and for allegedly insulting Islam.

An appeals court later overturned the ruling and ordered a retrial.

In January, Badawi was lashed 50 times in public, despite widespread international outrage and calls for clemency from human rights groups.

Saudi Arabia later postponed his public lashings, supposed to be conducted weekly after Friday prayers, on medical grounds, according to Amnesty.

The United Nations joined a chorus of countries, including the United States, that called for Badawi to be pardoned.
