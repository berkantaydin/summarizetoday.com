When I met Mahmoud, Abdullah and Eesa, they were being kicked out of a fast food restaurant across from Istanbulâs grand bazaar.

At 10, 11 and 12-years-old, their families were depending on them.

If they want to go on a field trip, we try to provide the transport and the food.

"The world is crashing down on us."

Sadly, it's a sight that's become familiar across Istanbul; young Syrian refugee children on street corners, hands outstretched, when they should be in school.

According to the United Nations Children's Fund, there are now an estimated 900,000 Syrian children living in Turkey.

For those in government run camps, schools are provided.

A somewhat chaotic patchwork of government agencies and charities try to provide education for the equally chaotic influx of families, but resources are stretched and many children are still growing up on the streets without a basic education.

It was this same sight that moved Nasirah Boudeh, a Moroccan who's lived in Istanbul for so long that she's now more comfortable speaking Turkish than Arabic.

Unusual partnership

Their biggest obstacle was finding a space for the school in Fatih, Istanbul's historic - and overcrowded -district.

We started with 25 students," she told me.

The school expanded to 100 students.

"We share whatever facilities the sports ministry provides us.

The textbooks were provided by an educational charity, while the sports club helped to get uniforms and jackets.

In some parts of the city tensions are rising, as locals feel the growing refugee population is exacerbating a housing shortage and adding to the strain on resources.

But here, in this part of Fatih, there's a bit of positivity in the air.
