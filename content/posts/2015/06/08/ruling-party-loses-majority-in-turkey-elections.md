The ruling Justice and Development Party (AK party) has won Turkey's parliamentary polls, but lost its single-party government, according to the preliminary results.

The country's pro-Kurdish left-wing Peoples' Democracy Party (HDP)Â crossed the country's unusually high 10 percent electoral threshold that affected the distribution of seats and, consequently, the power of the ruling party.

Official results based on 99.9 percent of votes counted gave the AK party 41 percent of Sunday's votes, while the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) scored 25 percent.

The Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) secured 16.5 percent of the votes, while the HDP won 13 percent.

About 54 million citizens were eligible to vote in the polls, with 86 percent of attendance rate, according to Turkey's semi-official Anatolia news agency.

The CHP, MHP and HDP are projected to secure 132, 81 and 79 seats respectively.

'Our march will continue' Â

The AK party, which currently has 311 seats in parliament, has ruled the country with a single-majority government for the last 13 years.

"Our nation's decision is final.

"For long marches, 13 years is a short time.

"Turkey's democracy proved itself.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Davutoglu had campaigned to write a new constitution to bolster the powers of the country's presidential office.Â The AK party needed at least 330 seats to unilaterally initiate such a change and take it to a referendum.Â All the other three main parties are against a presidential system.

The party had independent candidates in the last two polls that significantly decreased the number of the MPs it won through Turkey's electoral system.

"The ones who are authoritarian and arrogant lost, and the ones who are in love with the liberty and peace in Turkey won in the polls," Selahattin Demirtas, the co-chairperson of the HDP, said in a televised statement.

"We, the oppressed of Turkey, have beaten a government who used all the state's facilities against us, to attack usâ¦ This is the victory of the oppressed and alienated in Turkey," he added.

Both HDP and CHP officials said that the debate for a presidential system ended in Turkey.

Haluk Koc, the CHP spokesman, said that the AK party became increasingly authoritarian throughout its 13-year government.

"The country has avoided a one-person dictatorship and a civilian coup," he said, adding that his party was the key party to form the new government.Â

'Voters punished AK party'

Garo Paylan, an HDP candidate from Istanbul who is likely to make his way to the parliament, told Al Jazeera that Turkish voters punished the AK party's divisive rhetoric.

"The results show that the citizens of Turkey have expressed their support for the HDP's language that has been calling for all the citizens of Turkey to live together in harmony," Paylan said.

"We want all political parties in Turkey to see this picture and make their contributions to form a new culture for all citizens of this country to live harmoniously together.

Thousands of Kurds in the country's predominantlyÂ Kurdish southeastern Turkey celebrated the unofficial results,Â setting off fireworks and waving HDP flags.

The political atmosphere was tense in the region before the polls, with bombings targeting HDP buildings and rallies.Â

It got votes from liberal voters who previously voted for the AK party and CHP and who wanted to block Erdogan and AK party this time," Deniz Ulke Aribogan, a professor of political science from Istanbul Bilgi University, told Al Jazeera.

"The results show that Turkish citizens want Erdogan to act in line with his position as a neutral president.
