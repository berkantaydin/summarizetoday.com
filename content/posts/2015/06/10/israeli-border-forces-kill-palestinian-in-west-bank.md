A Palestinian man has been killed in a clash with Israeli forces at theÂ Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank, medical and security sources said.

The sources told the AFP news agency that Ezzedine Ghora, 23, was hit by two bullets in his arm and chest early on Wednesday, and died before reaching hospital.

A statement from Israeli police said border police were in the Jenin refugee camp to conduct arrests.

"Upon leaving the camp, the force identified a suspect trying to throw an explosive device at them," it said.

One of the border police shot him and wounded him, the statement said, noting the device probably exploded near the suspect.
