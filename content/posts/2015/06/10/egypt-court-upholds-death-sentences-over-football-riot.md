An Egyptian court has upheld deathÂ sentences against 11 football fans over a February 2012 Â riot in Port SaidÂ that cost the lives of more than 70 people.

Tuesday's verdict came at the end of the retrial of 73 defendants.

The death sentences have angered some whoÂ accuse the judiciary of trying to cover up state punishment of football fans who took part in the 2011 revolution.
